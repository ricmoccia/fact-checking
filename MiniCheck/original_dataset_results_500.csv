"The SFA's performance director has been conducting a review since taking over from Mark Wotte. Across the seven schools involved throughout Scotland, 374 children receive up to 10 hours a week specialised coaching as part of their everyday studies. ""There's been a lot of time invested in this project by a lot of people and we're looking at how we continue to improve the programme as we travel through the years,"" McClair told BBC Scotland. The project is now in its fourth year, with this year's intake of pupils the final one of the initial scheme. McClair will decide in the coming months whether it will continue in its current format once an analysis of how it is working has been concluded. Alternatives could include certificating the programme to award pupils a Higher qualification for completing the course or focusing on a smaller group of children at one single, residential campus rather than the seven schools involved just now. At the very least, the current system will continue until this year's S1 pupils have completed fourth year. Gauging its success thus far is tricky, with the oldest participants still only in S4, but McClair believes there are some good indicators. ""I think you can be encouraged by the number of young people who have been in the performance schools who have been in the younger representative squads over the last three-and-a-bit years and the evidence suggests that will continue,"" he added. ""By summertime I think it'll be a half-decent measure of the number of young boys who are being offered the opportunity to go into full-time football, although I believe that's changing a little bit in the sense that it's 16 or 17 that some clubs are looking at taking them in full-time. ""The idea's great. Many clubs in England have taken it on board - getting kids in during the day, giving them more opportunities to practise the disciplines involved in football. ""The evidence is all there that they're improving quicker than they were previously under a hybrid programme where all the coaching was taking place in the evening or at weekends."" The other important gauge of success is academic achievement. Exam results will not be available from the SFA project until this summer, but Graeme High School in Falkirk ran a pilot scheme - of which Craig Sibbald and Celtic youngster Paul McMullan are graduates - that allows for some analysis. ""Last year we had a group of 14 or 15 and the vast majority were highly successful, able pupils, one with five Highers, two with four Highers, three with three Highers and a suite of other academic achievements,"" headteacher Lesley Carroll told BBC Scotland. ""Most of them have gone on to professional clubs but they have got a fallback position. They have been some of our top-performing academic pupils too because not only do they have to be elite athlete footballers, they have to have what the SFA would call a growth mindset. ""They're not afraid of targets, hard work, commitment, drive and confidence."" Indeed, Carroll believes there is an argument the programme helps the performance school students achieve better results in their other subjects, though she admits no ""real forensic research has been done into that"". But it will be the level of footballing development that determines exactly how McClair and the SFA proceed in terms of their future performance strategy.","The Scottish Football Association is considering the future of its performance school programme for young footballers, according to new chief executive Martin McClair.",0,1,0.7932264804840088
"It's no surprise which image is making the headlines from this week's gathering of leaders from nearly three dozen nations in Panama: A historic handshake between President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro. But this first meeting of Obama and Castro since they announced plans to start normalizing diplomatic ties should not be the end of the summit story. Or at least Obama is hoping it won't be. After all, the President has had some unhappy experiences at hemispheric summits, where the headlines have often focused on some less than flattering moments. The reality is that the United States has been losing ground in this increasingly important region, and Obama needs to put on a strong performance in Panama at the Summit of the Americas if the U.S. is to have a chance of improving ties with neighbors who should be best friends, but who have drifted away as America has been focused on challenges at home and instability in the Middle East. Unfortunately, America has lost influence in Latin America to a hyperactive China, a cunning Russia and a troubling Iran, all of which have made inroads in the region at Washington's expense. This gathering therefore offers a chance for the U.S. to reverse the tide and build on the potential offered by a natural alliance strengthened by millions of people with Latin American and Caribbean blood who make their homes in the United States. The foundations for a strong hemispheric bloc are there. But they need attention, and the Panama meeting offers a good opportunity to start building. But first: Do no harm. Large diplomatic gatherings are minutely orchestrated events, and the U.S., with its vast experience in preparing for high-level multilateral meetings, knows the importance of dotting the I's and crossing the T's. But this hasn't stopped recent summits descending into diplomatic and PR disasters for the U.S. Just look at the last summit, held in Cartagena, Colombia, which stayed in the news much longer than anyone expected after Secret Service agents embarrassed the United States by hiring prostitutes and bringing them to their hotel rooms, in violation of basic security protocols. They were reportedly caught after one of the women accused an agent of refusing to pay an agreed fee. As a result of all this, the Americans looked dumb, incompetent -- and cheap. And back in 2009, the President -- new on the job -- was caught flat footed by a fast-talking, fiery anti-American president of Venezuela. The late Hugo Chavez outplayed the leader of the free world, who had just taken office and was trying to show America's new ""outstretched hand"" toward the foe of the George W. Bush era. The summit hit a depressing low for the Obama administration when Chavez walked up to Obama and, as the cameras clicked, handed the American President a copy of the book ""Open Veins of Latin America,"" which blames the region's woes on the U.S. and Europe. Yet the problems in Cartagena weren't just symbolic. Regional leaders lined up against Washington, which had refused to include Cuba in the summit, and vowed they would not hold any more of the gatherings unless Havana was also invited. America was cornered. All this stands in contrast to the optimism of the early Clinton years, when the President issued an invitation to ""democratically elected"" heads of state of Latin America, which was then breaking the chains of military dictatorship. Back then, the U.S. had just led the creation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and actually seemed to stand for something attractive to the region, namely democracy, free trade and economic growth. That's what it should aim for every time: articulating a clear vision and rallying neighbors behind it. Can Obama manage something similar this time? True, the President has come armed with his new Cuba policy. Unfortunately, in an effort to placate critics who say Obama is not doing more for pro-democracy activists, the White House has miscalculated with Venezuela, handing the repressive regime of Chavez's successor, Nicolas Maduro, a stick with which to beat the U.S. Obama has long and rightly ignored Maduro's claims that the U.S. planned to overthrow him. But a modest plan to impose sanctions has suddenly handed Maduro -- who has presided over an economic catastrophe in his country -- a way to portray himself a victim of the U.S., something he will no doubt play that up in Panama. All this risks again reviving memories of past tensions with Latin Americans who already have complicated feelings toward the U.S. over its Cold War support for unseemly right-wing dictators, a policy it claimed to pursue in the name of preventing Soviet-backed communism from taking hold. But those days are behind us. Today, the people want prosperity, they want democracy, and they want the rule of law -- all of which leave a potential opening for the United States. Too many national leaders are eroding democratic norms: Opposition leaders are in prison in Venezuela; a prosecutor who criticized the President was found dead in Argentina; press freedom is under siege in several countries; and corruption is reaching new highs. All of this suggests that if Obama plays his cards right, he will have the opportunity to explain to the people of Latin America that their goals are also America's goals; that like them, he supports democracy, human rights, the rule of law, full freedom of expression and free elections in every country. The fact that he met with Cuban dissidents was welcome, and sends a message that he is not neglecting other issues such as human rights as he recasts relations with Cuba. For the millions in Latin America that still live in poverty, these freedoms can seem like a distant luxury. But if Obama can show them that the United States is a true partner in efforts to improve their lives, then he will leave a longer-lasting legacy in the region than just a handshake.

"As Saudi forces pounded southern Yemen with a fresh series of airstrikes Wednesday, Houthi rebels called for peace talks. The U.N.-sponsored talks should resume ""but only after a complete halt of attacks,"" Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam said in a Facebook post. The previous round of talks between Houthi rebels and the government of Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi failed in January after rebels attacked the President's personal residence and presidential palace in Sanaa, the Yemeni capital. On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia announced the end of its Operation Decisive Storm, a nearly monthlong air campaign against Houthi positions. The Saudi-led coalition said a new initiative was underway, Operation Renewal of Hope, focused on the political process. But less than 24 hours later, after rebel forces attacked a Yemeni government military brigade, the airstrikes resumed, according to security sources in Taiz. Five airstrikes targeted a weapons depot in the province late Wednesday, two Taiz security officials said. Explosions lasted for about 40 minutes, they said. It was unclear whether it was a resumption of the operation or a short-term series of strikes. Meanwhile, Houthis released Yemeni Defense Minister Mahmoud al-Subaihi in Sanaa on Wednesday, according to a senior Saudi source speaking on condition of anonymity. The Houthis had said they detained the defense minister at an air base near the Yemeni port city of Aden on March 26, shortly before the Saudis began their airstrike campaign. The rebels captured the base that day as part of an advance on the Aden area. The United Nations demanded al-Subaihi's release earlier this month. Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners launched airstrikes on Houthi positions across Yemen starting on March 26, hoping to wipe out the Iranian-allied rebel group that overthrew the government and seized power. The Saudis say they want to restore the Yemeni government -- a key U.S. ally in the fight against al Qaeda -- which was kicked out of the capital by the rebels earlier this year. This month, Saudi officials said airstrikes have degraded Houthi-controlled military infrastructure, including key buildings in Sanaa. The campaign achieved its objectives ""by a very good planning, very precise execution, by the courage of our pilots, our sailors, our soldiers,"" said Brig. Gen. Ahmed Asiri, a Saudi military spokesman. A senior Saudi official told CNN that the Houthis agreed to ""nearly all demands"" of the U.N. Security Council. Former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and his family will leave Yemen and never return for a position in politics, the source said. A statement from the Saudi Embassy in Washington outlined objectives of the next phase of operations, including protecting civilians, enhancing humanitarian and medical assistance, confronting terrorism and creating an international coalition to provide maritime security. Ground troops will continue to protect the border and confront any attempts to destabilize the situation, Asiri said. Military action will be taken if needed. Houthi leader: 'Anyone who thinks we will surrender is dreaming' But beyond the military campaign, the Saudis and their allies have said they want to find a political solution for the violence-plagued nation. The aim is to bring back ""security and stability through establishing a political process,"" said a statement from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait. Hadi, who claims he's Yemen's legitimate leader, thanked the Saudi-led coalition. He is working with the Saudis and other allies to return to his country. ""We promise to restructure the Yemen military to ensure that it serves the people of Yemen,"" Hadi said, calling on the Houthis to withdraw, and saying that he would return to Yemen at ""the right time"" to rebuild the country. ""You will witness many changes in the days to come in our mission to build an institutional government and military, far from rebel militancy,"" said Hadi. In the country's south, security officials on Wednesday reported two U.S. drone strikes against al Qaeda militants in Mukalla. Six suspected militants died in the attack. This is the second drone strike in three days. On Monday, six militants were killed when drone strikes targeted two vehicles in Shabwah, west of Mukalla. A U.S. military official told CNN on Tuesday that the United States is conducting ""manned reconnaissance"" off Yemen. The official stressed that the repositioning of U.S. ships over the last few days was not done to interdict Iranian ships, but to ensure freedom of navigation and maritime security. Why is Saudi Arabia bombing Yemen? CNN's Nic Robertson, Salim Essaid, Jethro Mullen, Tim Lister, Anas Hamdan, Jamie Crawford and journalist Hakim Almasmari contributed to this report.

"A longtime friend of Joni Mitchell has filed a legal petition seeking to be named the singer-songwriter's conservator. Mitchell, who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, was taken to UCLA Medical Center a month ago after being found unconscious in her home. She remains at the hospital, according to Leslie Morris' court petition filed April 28. Morris is described as Mitchell's friend of more than 44 years in the legal documents. Whether the folk and jazz singer is conscious remains a matter of some confusion. In her April 28 petition, Morris says Mitchell is unconscious: ""At this time she (Mitchell) remains unconscious and unable to make any responses, and is therefore unable to provide for any of her personal needs."" But on Mitchell's website, a statement posted the same day that says it was approved by Morris says Mitchell is alert. ""Contrary to rumors circulating on the Internet today, Joni is not in a coma. Joni is still in the hospital -- but she comprehends, she's alert, and she has her full senses. A full recovery is expected. The document obtained by a certain media outlet simply gives her longtime friend Leslie Morris the authority -- in the absence of 24-hour doctor care -- to make care decisions for Joni once she leaves the hospital."" When asked about the discrepancy between statements about Mitchell's health on her website and in the legal filing, her publicist, Alisse Kingsley, responded that ""the website"" was accurate.

"Chris Copeland of the Indiana Pacers was stabbed after leaving a trendy New York nightclub early Wednesday, and two Atlanta Hawks -- who had just finished a home game hours before the incident -- were among those arrested, according to police and CNN affiliates. The Hawks were not involved in the stabbing incident, police said, but were arrested on obstruction and other charges later. Though New York Police Department Det. Kelly Ort initially told CNN the incident occurred just before 4 a.m. at 1OAK, a club in New York's Chelsea neighborhood known to draw celebrities among its clientele, the club later told CNN that the stabbing occurred in front of the Fulton Houses project down the street. ""1OAK staff was unaware of the incident when it happened, as it occurred beyond their view in a different location. However, 1OAK's team assisted Mr. Copeland to their fullest capabilities, and called for help as soon as he was seen walking back towards the venue,"" the statement said. The statement continued, ""A review of the video footage seems to reveal the incident did not originate from the venue or its immediate surroundings that are under 1OAK supervision."" Copeland and a female companion, Katrine Saltara, were in the club for about 10 minutes before leaving and walking down the street toward Fulton Houses, where their car was parked, said a 1OAK spokesperson. The spokesperson gave CNN additional details on condition of anonymity because 1OAK's legal team had approved only the club's official statement. The suspect, who the spokesperson said never entered 1OAK, stabbed Copeland and Saltara in front of Fulton Houses, and according to the club's statement, ""Mr. Copeland's driver sprang to accost and detain the apparent perpetrator and that individual is now in police custody."" Charges against the suspect are pending, and his name will be released once charges are filed, Ort said. Copeland and Saltara tried to make their way back to the club to seek help from the 20 or so security personnel on hand, leaving a ""bloody trail of handprints"" between the site of the stabbing and the club, the spokesperson said. Copeland ""almost landed right next to the club,"" the spokesperson said, adding that surveillance footage will not show the actual stabbing because it occurred too far away from the club. The club shut down immediately after the incident, the spokesperson said. A male and two females were taken to area hospitals, Ort said. A knife was recovered, a suspect was arrested and two individuals not involved in the dispute -- the Hawks' Pero Antic, 32, and Thabo Sefolosha, 30 -- were arrested on charges of obstructing governmental administration and disorderly conduct, she said. Sefolosha faces an additional charge of resisting arrest, Ort said. Word of the stabbing quickly spread through the club, reaching Antic and Sefolosha, who went outside to check on their friend, Copeland, the 1OAK spokesperson said. At one point, the two began pushing their way through a crowd that had gathered around the scene, leading to their arrests, the spokesperson said. ""We will contest these charges and look forward to communicating the facts of the situation at the appropriate time,"" the players said in a joint statement released by the team. ""We apologize to our respective families, teammates, and the Hawks' organization for any negative attention this incident has brought upon them."" The Hawks are in New York for a Wednesday night game against the Brooklyn Nets. Neither player will be in uniform, the team said. Police released little information Wednesday, but local media identified the injured man as Copeland, 31, who is from Orange, New Jersey. The Pacers released a statement saying Copeland suffered a knife wound to his left elbow and abdomen, and he's in stable condition at a New York hospital. ""We are aware that Chris Copeland was injured early this morning in New York City. We are still gathering information and will update when we know more. Our thoughts are with Chris and those injured,"" Larry Bird, the Pacers' president of basketball operations, said in a statement. Copeland's agent, John Spencer, issued a statement saying, ""We're concerned about the safety of Chris and Katrine. We don't have any details at this particular time. All we can do is pray and wait."" The NBA and the Hawks front office said they were looking into the incident. ""We are aware of the situation involving Pero Antic and Thabo Sefolosha this morning. We are in the process of gathering more information and will have further comment at the appropriate time,"" Hawks spokesman Garin Narain said in an email. Copeland's Pacers are slated to play the New York Knicks on Wednesday night. The pair apparently had only recently arrived in New York prior to their arrests, as both were on the court for the Hawks' 96-69 win over the Phoenix Suns in Atlanta on Tuesday night. Antic played 12 minutes, and Sefolosha played 20. The game ended around 10 p.m. Copeland, a former Knick, was near the nightclub with Saltara when a 22-year-old Brooklyn man approached them, police told CNN affiliate WABC. There was some sort of dispute before the suspect stabbed the 6-foot-8-inch Copeland in the abdomen, slashed Saltara and then slashed another woman, the station reported. Saltara suffered cuts to her arm, breast and buttock, and the other woman suffered a slash to her stomach, CNN affiliate WCBS reported. While WCBS reported that the second woman was 53 years old, WABC reported she was 23. Images published in the New York Daily News showed a considerable amount of blood on the sidewalk and a white sports coupe, roped off with police tape, with several streaks of blood on its driver's side. Antic and Sefolosha interfered with officers trying to establish a crime scene, and one of the Hawks pushed a police officer, WABC reported. The Hawks are preparing for a historic playoff run after clinching the No. 1 seed in the NBA's Eastern Conference. Tuesday's win over the Suns marked a franchise-best 58 wins in a season for the club. The Pacers sit in the conference's 10th spot but are only one game out of playoff contention. CNN's Laura Ly, Jason Durand and Jill Martin contributed to this report.

"Radioimmunoassay is one of the sensitive immunoassay techniques which helps in the determination of antigens or antibodies in a sample with the use of radioisotopes .
It is an in vitro type of antigen-antibody interaction .
When radioisotopes instead of enzymes are used as labels to be conjugated with antigens or antibodies, the technique of detection of the antigen-antibody complex is called radioimmunoassay (RIA). Radioimmunoassay (RIA) is an in vitro assay that measures the presence of an antigen with very high sensitivity. RIA was first described in 1960 for the measurement of endogenous plasma insulin by Solomon Berson and Rosalyn Yalow of the Veterans Administration Hospital in New York.
The classical RIA methods are based on the principle of competitive binding. In this method, an unlabeled antigen competes with a radiolabeled antigen for binding to an antibody with the appropriate specificity. Thus, when mixtures of radiolabeled and unlabeled antigen are incubated with the corresponding antibody, the amount of free (not bound to antibody) radiolabeled antigen is directly proportional to the quantity of unlabeled antigen in the mixture.
Table of Contents
Radiolabeled antigens: The antigens are generally labeled with gamma-ray emitting isotopes such as I-125 and beta-ray emitting isotopes such as Tritium. They are also called hot antigens.
S pecific Antibodies: They are required in smaller amounts than antigens.
Unlabeled antigens (sample antigens): They are also called cold antigens.
M icrotitre plates: 96 wells microtitre plate
Washing Buffer solutions: Wash buffer such as 1% Trifluoroacetic acid is used.
Marine Project Hopes To Bring Back Oyster Population Around the UK
Antigens and antibodies bind specifically to form the Ag-Ab complex. The antigen can be labeled or conjugated with radioisotopes. The unlabeled antigens from the sample compete with radiolabeled antigens to bind on paratopes of specific antibodies. The unlabeled antigens replace labeled antigens that are already linked with the antibodies. The unlabeled antigens when bind with antibodies, increases the amount of free radiolabeled antigens in the solution. Hence the concentration of free labeled antigens is directly proportional to the bound unlabeled antigens.
It involves a combination of three principles.
- An immune reaction i.e. antigen , antibody binding.
- A competitive binding or competitive displacement reaction. (It gives specificity)
- Measurement of radio emission. (It gives sensitivity)
When a foreign biological substance enters the body’s bloodstream through a non-oral route, the body recognizes the specific chemistry on the surface of the foreign substance as antigen and produces specific antibodies against the antigen so as nullify the effects and keep the body safe. The antibodies are produced by the body’s immune system so, it is an immune reaction. Here the antibodies or antigens bind and move due to chemical influence. This is different from the principle of electrophoresis where proteins are separated due to charge.
This is a phenomenon wherein when there are two antigens that can bind to the same antibody, the antigen with more concentration binds extensively with the limited antibody displacing others. So here in the experiment, a radiolabelled antigen is allowed to bind to a high-affinity antibody. Then when the patient serum is added to unlabeled antigens it starts binding to the antibody displacing the labeled antigen.
Once the incubation is over, then washings are done to remove any unbound antigens. Then radio emission of the antigen-antibody complex is taken, and the gamma rays from the radiolabeled antigen are measured.
The target antigen is labeled radioactively and bound to its specific antibodies (a limited and known amount of the specific antibody has to be added). A sample, for e.g. blood serum, is added in order to initiate a competitive reaction of the labeled antigens from the preparation, and the unlabeled antigens from the serum sample, with the specific antibodies. The competition for the antibodies will release a certain amount of labeled antigen. This amount is proportional to the ratio of labeled to an unlabeled antigen. A binding curve can then be generated which allows the amount of antigen in the patient’s serum to be derived. That means as the concentration of unlabeled antigen is increased, more of it binds to the antibody, displacing the labeled variant. The bound antigens are then separated from the unbound ones, and the radioactivity of the free antigens remaining in the supernatant is measured.
Antigen-antibody complexes are precipitated either by crosslinking with a second antibody or by means of the addition of reagents that promote the precipitation of antigen-antibody complexes. Counting radioactivity in the precipitates allows the determination of the amount of radiolabeled antigen precipitated with the antibody. A standard curve is constructed by plotting the percentage of antibody-bound radiolabeled antigen against known concentrations of a standardized unlabeled antigen, and the concentrations of antigen in patient samples are extrapolated from that curve.
The extremely high sensitivity of RIA is its major advantage .
- Specific antibodies of known concentration are fixed in the microtitre well.
- A known amount of hot antigens is then added to the well
- Washed carefully to remove any unbound antigens
- At this point, the radioactivity of the well will be maximum.
- Unlabeled antigens are then added to the well
- The unlabeled antigens will bind to the antibodies and there will be free labeled antigens in the well.
- Again washed carefully to remove the free labeled antigens.
- Radioactivity of wells is then measured by gamma-counter.
At first, the labeled antigens will bind to the antibodies hence radioactivity will be maximum.
If the sample contains specific antigens of interest, it will bind to the antibodies releasing labeled antigens and hence the radioactivity of the solution will decrease.
So by observation of decreasing radioactivity, it can be confirmed that the antigen of interest is present in the sample. And if the radioactivity remains the same, it can be called a negative test.
With the increasing concentration of unlabeled antigens, the radioactivity decreases. By plotting a graph of radioactivity(in percentage) vs concentration of unlabeled antigens, a standard curve is obtained.
The sample to be assayed is run parallel following a similar procedure and the radioactivity measured is calibrated with the standard curve to determine the concentration of the antigen.
- It was first used for the detection of peptide hormones.
- Detection of different viral antigens
- Detection of many hormones and drugs
- Detection of Hepatitis B surface antigens
- Detection of mycotoxins
- Detection of the early stage of cancer",The technique of detection of the antigen-antibody complex is based on the in vitro type of antigen-antibody interaction.,0,1,0.852083683013916

I\'ve been wanting to eat here for several years based on what I thought was a great reputation in town.  I don\'t get over to the Mesa much but when I saw a coupon in a mailed flyer a couple months ago, I clipped it.  It offered a free entree with purchase of one entree and two drinks. Even with a discount of $12, the bill was $53 for lunch (before tip) -- I can eat a great dinner out for less than this -- so I was expecting a very delicious meal.  Both my companion and I felt the food was vastly overpriced for the quality, flavor and even presentation. The quantity was generous enough but the items we ordered (empanadas and the mushroom burger) were both rather bland.  The ""burger"" was served on a doughy, barely cooked pita-like bread rather than on an appropriate item to hold a messy burger in place like a brioche bun.  It was completely falling apart after a few bites... which would have been okay to eat with a fork except it was just not flavorful or complex given the list of ingredients. The most interesting item was the ketchup made from beets.  Also the side fries weren\'t thoroughly cooked except for the smallest ones.  Definitely not a $24 item! The empanadas were somewhat better but again, not a \'wow\' and not even a \'hey, really tasty.\' Just bland and again, not worth $24.  The half-off discount didn\'t even cover the $13 cost of a chai tea and lemonade (that was mostly ice of course).  All in all, very disappointing food and therefore completely overpriced.  We took the food to go so I cannot really comment on the service. When I read another lengthy review (12/5/21), I now see that the prices have been jacked and the quality has been wavering.

"MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN ANCHOR: More than 200 illegal immigrants from Haiti are now at a detention center today in Florida, awaiting processing. The Haitians were rounded up yesterday after many of them jumped from a packed wooden boat into the surf off of Key Biscayne. Immigration authorities are conducting a criminal investigation, as Susan Candiotti reports now live from Miami. Susan, it was a wild scene to watch as it developed.
SUSAN CANDIOTTI, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It was. A very, still emotionally and politically charged issue, as these more than 200, as you indicated, Haitian migrants making their way to the Miami shoreline yesterday afternoon. You saw these pictures, which are, as we said, quite remarkable. Men, women and children jumping from this boat, in shallow waters around Miami's Key Biscayne area and in fact wading to shore. Many of these people wearing their Sunday finest clothes as they made this treacherous journey from Haiti to the United States. Very controversial in this particular area because, you can see the crossing that they made. And they were at sea for many, many, many days. And it is controversial because of the difference between the way Haitian migrants, or example and Cuban migrants. Cubans, for the most part, are treated as political refugees. And if they reach the shores, they are automatically allowed to remain in the United States. That is not the case with Haitian migrants who most always are sent back because they are viewed as economic refugees. However, all of these migrants will be able to make their case. They hope, anyway, if they are able to hire lawyers and try to make a case, many of them, that they are political refugees, as well. Now, today there was a brief meeting set up during a campaign appearance by Governor Jeb Bush, who is, of course, campaigning for re-election here. And he made a stop at a local school in Miami. At that time, among the people who were there on the podium with him, Congressman Carrie Meek -- Congresswoman Carrie Meek who is a Democrat, and she directly approached the governor on this issue in a very dramatic way. Listen.
REP. CARRIE MEEK (D), FLORIDA: I came to ask you if you would call your brother and ask him to call INS to release the Haitians that are in detention. They don't need a new policy. All they have to do is call. The wet foot/dry foot policy will take effect. Those Haitians are standing on dry land. My blood has been transferred to them, governor.
BUSH: Congresswoman, I appreciate it.
QUESTION: I love them.
BUSH: I respect your position.
QUESTION: Please, call him, governor, and ask him to please -- you can do it.
BUSH: Thank you.
QUESTION: We can't do it. The Congress can't do it. We tried our best. We can't do it. If you call him...
BUSH: You know, we worked together in 1998 to change the immigration laws. With your leadership, that occurred to provide for more just treatment of Haitians. My position is, as I stated, if people have a well-founded fear of persecution, they should be allowed into the community, out of Krome and they should be able to pursue those remedies through administrative...
QUESTION: Tell your brother they can be released right now. You can.
CANDIOTTI: Well, Haitian Americans plan to keep drumming this issue as best they can. And there have been a number of demonstrations, a couple yesterday, one this morning, and another one scheduled outside the offices and headquarters of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Services this afternoon as many people protest the treatment of these Haitian migrants. It's certainly an issue, Martin, that is not going to go away any time soon. It comes up time and again. And all kinds of questions being raised about it again. And not a good time, certainly, for Governor Jeb Bush during his re-election campaign.
SAVIDGE: That's what I was going to ask you about. You mention the issue of timing here. Jeb Bush in a very tight race and now this literally lands on his doorstep. What are the potential pitfalls for him?
CANDIOTTI: Reporter: well, certainly there could be major pitfalls for him in certain segments of the community. Those people who think that these migrants are being treated unfairly might decide to take up this issue and, you know, go against Governor Jeb Bush at the election polls. We have not heard yet, to the best of my knowledge, from his opponent, Democrat Jim McBride, who is running against Governor Jeb Bush. So we'll wait to see what happens as the day goes on.

"Every day, images of war and conflict are splashed across our desktops, plastered on our TV screens and scattered through our mobile news feeds. Because of that, one's response to such imagery often becomes calloused or desensitized. This concept of ""how we digest images of war through mainstream media outlets,"" was what drove photographer Simon Brann Thorpe to begin his project ""Toy Soldiers."" This idea to create a fresh perspective drove him into the desert of Western Sahara, a long-disputed region of northwestern Africa. Thorpe uses the area's harsh landscape as a powerful backdrop for soldiers posed as green plastic figurines -- similar to the popular toys that many children play with. The soldiers are with the Polisario Front, an independence movement that has been clashing with Morocco over the region since the mid-1970s. Thorpe said his project enables ""the creation of a visual metaphor from which a viewer develops their own emotional, physical and political response to war and conflict, when faced with the realization that the images do not contain toy soldiers but real soldiers."" Thorpe's background was not in photojournalism, but in landscape photography, which lends to his powerful placement of the soldiers in the desert -- not to mention that all the locations chosen are historic locations of battles between Morocco and the Polisario Front. ""The conflict in Western Sahara receives virtually zero coverage despite 2015 being the 40th anniversary of the outbreak of war there,"" Thorpe said. After a ceasefire in 1991, the people of Western Sahara have been living in a state of non-resolution. The people are split into two camps -- those living in Moroccan-occupied territory, and those in refugee camps in Algeria. Social media. Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. Thorpe had to get clearance to work with the Polisario Front military and also had to be cautious of how many troops he moved about at one time -- otherwise he would have needed permission from the United Nations. He usually worked with about 50 or 60 soldiers at a time. The autumn months did not offer much reprieve from the long hours in the sweltering desert sun. Thorpe would work with the troops' commander to position the men, then climb atop sandy mountains with his wide-angle lens and capture these striking images. They would work till dusk and then spend the night under the stars. Not only were the soldiers willing participants for this project, but they also helped construct the platforms they stood on. Thorpe said they were made out of old oil drums. After the elaborate five-week production, Thorpe hopes his images will raise questions on ""how images of war (will) be consumed in the future with ever-diminishing attention spans and competition for them.""

"Speaker 1: Motion carries.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Item 22.
Speaker 1: Report from City Manager. Recommendation to Request City Attorney to prepare a resolution to oppose Proposition six. The voter approval for future gas and vehicle taxes and 2017 tax repeal initiative citywide.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Ringo.
Speaker 2: Yes. Given the importance that SB one has provided for not only the city limits, but for the state as a whole, I think it's very important that we oppose this proposition because it would have a devastating effect on all the projects that we currently have going in the city alone, which because of SB one, and when you look at what's going on with the replacement bridge at the replacement Desmond Bridge, it would be a bridge going to nowhere if we didn't have the funds to finish that project. And we have as well some other projects in Long Beach, including the Long Beach Boulevard and Pacific Coast Highway and a lot of other projects that we have because of SB one. So I would strongly suggest let's just so strongly support the city council opposing measure. I mean, Proposition six.
Speaker 0: Becky, there's a motion and a second seconded by Councilman Austin. Councilman Austin.
Speaker 8: Yes. I'd also like to just weigh in and say, I think it's important for us to to stand by what we've worked for as a council and support it for for several years. It was the Fix Our Roads kind of campaign through the League of California Cities, a lot of our legislative advocacy for infrastructure support and dollars for state highways, but also for local roads as well, that this these dollars actually will go a long way, if I'm not mistaken. Stephanie, can you tell me specifically how much if SB six does pass, how much we would stand to lose as a city?
Speaker 2: Diana Chang.
Speaker 1: Good morning, Mayor.
Speaker 5: And Members of the City Council. SB 145 19 We've budgeted $8 million for.
Speaker 1: Projects in all nine council districts, and so those revenues would would likely.
Speaker 7: Be.
Speaker 5: Repealed and, and the projects would be without.
Speaker 1: A source of dedicated funding.
Speaker 8: So that's that's $8 million annually, correct?
Speaker 1: It's $8 million for FY 19.
Speaker 7: And as the revenues continue to be implemented as part of SB one, we're expecting them to grow to.
Speaker 5: 11 million in about FY 20 and then indexed to inflation thereafter. I would also like to note that this essentially doubles what the city currently receives from the state for streets.
Speaker 3: Streets and.
Speaker 1: Roads.
Speaker 5: Currently with just hooda the traditional source of state funding for streets and roads. Our our budget, it's about 10 million annually. So with SB one, we add another eight for FY19.
Speaker 7: About 11 for FY 20, and then adjusted to inflation every year thereafter.
Speaker 8: So I think it's a the the, the gas tax that we have is a small price to pay for, for good infrastructure investing in our future. The impact would be obviously significant for our public works infrastructure budget. And if we didn't if we lost those dollars, we'd have to be made up elsewhere. We and that would be less dollars that we could actually put toward residential streets, which I think are so important to our residents. And so for those reasons, I support this this motion to support to support or oppose. SB I'm to be very clear to oppose SB six.
Speaker 0: Six and let me add one thing that wasn't, I think unless I missed it in Dana Takes presentation, which is that the SB one not just not only includes all the street work and the annual funding that comes in, but they're also doing specific, larger streets. And part of SB one separate of what we're getting annually this year is the entire reconstruction of PCH from our entrance point in Orange County, all the way through the city to our exit point in in western Long Beach. And so that is a project that the state's doing that's in Long Beach that doesn't count towards our our amount. And so that that's a huge project that is obviously incredibly, incredibly expensive. And so that's why work goes through most of the city.

"Atlanta (CNN)A fake name on a Facebook post can still get you in real trouble, especially when you're threatening to shoot every white cop you see. Ebony Dickens of East Point, Georgia, posted her Facebook rant under the name Tiffany Milan, police said. ""All Black ppl should rise up and shoot at every white cop in the nation starting NOW,"" said the post made on Monday. ""I condone black on white killings. Hell they condone crimes against us."" The post was removed a day later, just before Dickens was arrested, CNN affiliate WSB reported. ""I thought about shooting every white cop I see in the head until I'm either caught by the police or killed by them.  Ha!!!!  I think I can pull it off.  Might kill at least 15 tomorrow, I'm plotting now."" Needless to say, it got law enforcement's attention. Not only the East Point police, but Atlanta police -- whose homeland security unit ""worked diligently ... to identify the true identity of the poster and her whereabouts,"" said Atlanta police spokeswoman Elizabeth Espy -- as well as the FBI and federal Homeland Security Department. ""That's 15 people that she's talking about killing within a day or so, so whether she is serious or not that's something that we have to take seriously,"" East Point police Lt. Cliff Chandler told WSB. Police in East Point -- a city of about 34,000 people just south of Atlanta -- said in a statement that, in addition to detailing how many police might die and threatening white officers specifically, the posts ""indicated that the acts were being plotted and were in motion."" After connecting Dickens to the Facebook post, authorities obtained a search warrant for her residence. They took her into custody while executing that warrant. ""A firearm along with three computers was located during the search,"" East Point police said. Dickens, 33, appeared in court Wednesday on a charge of disseminating information related to terrorist acts. A judge set a $10,000 bond for her and banned her from social media. She was then transferred to Fulton County Jail, where she remained until bonding out at 6:19 a.m. Thursday, according to county sheriff's office spokeswoman Tracy Flanagan.

"PUBLIC HEALTH CAMPAIGNS

Promoting public health and preventing the spread of dangerous health risks is an integral communication function in modern society. Whether the focus is on the prevention and control of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), cancer, heart disease, or community violence, a fusion of theory and practice in communication is urgently needed to guide effective promotion efforts. Public health campaigns involve a broad set of communication strategies and activities that specialists in health promotion engage in to disseminate relevant and persuasive health information to groups of people who need such information to help them lead healthy lives.

Public health campaigns involve the strategic dissemination of information to the public in order to help groups of people resist imminent health threats and adopt behaviors that promote good health. Typically, these campaigns are designed to raise public consciousness about important health issues by educating specific groups (i.e., target audiences) about imminent health threats and risky behaviors that might harm them. Health campaigns are generally designed both to increase awareness of health threats and to move target audiences to action in support of public health. For example, public health campaigns often encourage target audience members to engage in healthy behaviors that provide resistance to serious health threats. These behaviors can include adopting healthy lifestyles that include exercise, nutrition, and stress-reduction; avoiding dangerous substances such as poisons, carcinogens, or other toxic materials; seeking opportunities for early screening and diagnosis for serious health problems; and availing themselves of the best available health-care services, when appropriate, to minimize harm.

Frailty of Messages that Promote Health

Campaigns are designed to influence public knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors, yet achieving these goals and influencing the public is no simple matter. There is not a direct relationship between the messages that are sent to people and the reactions these people have to the messages. In addition to interpreting messages in very unique ways, people respond differently to the messages that they receive. For example, having drivers use their seatbelts when they drive might seem like a very straightforward public health goal. A very simple campaign might develop the message, ""Wear your seatbelt when you drive!"" For this message to influence the beliefs, attitudes, and values of all drivers, the campaign planner must take many different communication variables into account. Is this message clear and compelling for its intended audience? How are audience members likely to respond to this message? Will they pay attention to it? Will they adjust their behaviors in response to it? Campaign planners must do quite a bit of background research and planning to answer these questions. Effective communication campaigns must be strategically designed and implemented. In other words, they must use carefully designed messages that match the interests and abilities of the audience for which they are designed, and they must convey the messages via the communication channels that the target audience trusts and can easily access.

A primary goal of the campaign is to influence the way the audience thinks about the health threat. If the target audience already believes this issue is very serious and of great relevance to their lives, this will lead the campaign planner to craft messages that will support these preconceptions. If, on the other hand, members of the target audience barely recognize the health threat and are not at all concerned about it, the campaign planner must design communication strategies that will raise the audience's consciousness and concern about the topic.

Generally, campaign planners want to convince target audiences to recognize and take the identified health threat seriously. They want to influence the audience's beliefs, values, and attitudes about the issue to support the goals of the campaign. Only after a communication campaign raises audience consciousness and concern about the threat can it begin to influence (or persuade) the target audience to adopt specific recommendations for resisting and treating the identified health threat. The communication strategies used to raise consciousness and the strategies used to motivate action may be quite different.

Message Strategies and Communication Channels

Effective public health campaigns often employ a wide range of message strategies and communication channels to target high-risk populations with information designed to educate, motivate, and empower risk reduction behaviors. For this reason, modern campaigns have become increasingly dependent on integrating interpersonal, group, organizational, and mediated communication to disseminate the relevant health information effectively to specific high-risk populations.

Most campaigns use mass media (i.e., newspapers, radio, television, etc.) to convey their messages to large, and sometimes diverse, audiences. These channels for communication often have the ability to reach many people over vast geographic distances. In recognition of the multidimensional nature of health communication, the most effective public health campaigns develop information dissemination strategies that incorporate multiple levels and channels of human communication. To have the greatest potential influence on the health behaviors of the target audience, public health campaigns often employ a wide range of communication channels (e.g., interpersonal counseling, support groups, lectures, workshops, newspaper and magazine articles, pamphlets, self-help programs, computer-based information systems, formal educational programs, billboards, posters, radio and television programs, and public service announcements). The use of these different media is most effective when the campaign is designed so that the different communication channels complement one another in presenting the same public health messages to different targeted audiences.

Because effective use of communication channels is so important to the success of public health campaigns, research related to health communication can perform a central role in the development of an effective campaign. Such research helps campaign planners to identify consumer needs and orientations; target specific audiences; evaluate audience message behaviors; field test messages; guide message conceptualization and development; identify communication channels that have high audience reach, specificity, and influence; monitor the progress of campaign messages; and evaluate the overall effects of the campaign on target audiences and public health.

Strategic Public Health Campaign Model

Developing and implementing effective public health campaigns is a complex enterprise. Campaign planners must recognize that mere exposure to relevant health information will rarely lead directly to desired changes in health-related behavior. Edward Maibach, Gary Kreps, and Ellen Bonaguro (1993) address the complex relationship between communication efforts and campaign outcomes in their strategic health communication campaign model. This model identifies five major stages and twelve key issues that planners of public health campaigns should consider in developing and implementing their strategic campaigns. The major elements of the model are (1) campaign planning, (2) theories for guiding efforts at health promotion, (3) communication analysis, (4) campaign implementation, and (5) campaign evaluation and reorientation.

Campaign Planning

Campaign planning addresses two major issues, setting clear and realistic campaign objectives and establishing a clear consumer orientation to make sure that the campaign reflects the specific concerns and cultural perspectives of the target audiences. Realistic campaign objectives refer to the purposes of the campaign. Identifying an important public health threat or issue that can be effectively addressed by a campaign is a crucial first step. There must be an important health issue to address, and it must be a problem that poses significant risks for groups of people.

Is the identified health threat likely to be reduced through the implementation of a public health campaign? Are there clearly identified and proven strategies for addressing the threat that can be promoted by the campaign? Are members of the campaign audience likely to adopt the health strategies that will be promoted in the campaign? These questions must be answered before a public health campaign is started, or the planners risk wasting time and money on a campaign that will have a minimal effect on public health.

Adopting a consumer orientation means that the whole campaign is designed from the unique cultural perspective of the target audience and that members of the audience are involved as much as possible in the planning and implementation of the campaign. It is imperative that the campaign planners clearly understand the orientation and predisposition of the target audience in order to craft the most appropriate and effective campaign for that audience. Campaign planners must identify specific (well-segmented) target populations who are most at-risk for the identified health threats that will be addressed in the campaign. These populations of individuals become the primary audiences to receive strategic campaign messages.

Research related to public health campaigns focuses on the effective dissemination of relevant health information to promote public health. To develop and design persuasive campaign messages that will be influential with the specific target audiences, campaign planners must conduct audience analysis research to gather relevant information about the health behaviors and orientations of the target audiences. Audience analysis also helps campaign planners learn about the communication characteristics and predisposition of target audiences.

Theories for Guiding Efforts at Health Promotion

Once the basic campaign planning has been completed, it must be determined which established behavioral and social science theories will be used as guides for developing overall campaign strategies and materials. The best theories have been tested in many different contexts (with different populations) and provide the campaign planners with good advice in directing campaign efforts. Too often campaign planners are in such a rush to provide people with health-related messages that they do not carefully design their communication strategies.

Theory provides campaign planners with strategies for designing, implementing, and evaluating communication campaigns. There are a wide range of behavioral theories of communication, persuasion, and social influence that can be effectively used to guide public health campaigns. The theories that are adopted will direct the campaign planners' use of message strategies to influence key public audiences. For example, Albert Bandura (1989) developed an insightful theory concerning self-efficacy as a key variable in behavior change, which would lead campaign planners to develop message strategies that build the confidence of members of the target audience to implement and institutionalize campaign recommendations into their lives. Campaign planners who apply exchange theories to their efforts are likely to craft messages that identify the personal detriments of health risks and the benefits of adopting proposed behavioral changes. These theories direct the persuasive communication strategies used in public health campaigns.

Communication Analysis

Communication analysis identifies three critical issues in designing public health campaigns: (1) audience analysis and segmentation, (2) formative research, and (3) channel analysis and selection. Audience segmentation involves breaking down large culturally diverse populations into smaller more manageable and more homogenous target audiences for health promotion campaigns. The greater the cultural homogeneity (i.e., the more they share cultural attributes and backgrounds) of a target audience, the better able campaign planners are to design messages specifically for them. With a diverse target audience, the campaign planner is hard pressed to develop message strategies that will appeal to all parts of the population. It is far more effective to target an audience that shares important cultural traits and is likely to respond similarly to campaign message strategies.

After segmenting the target audience into the most culturally homogenous group possible, the campaign planners should, in order to guide the design of the campaign, gather as much information about the group's relevant cultural norms, beliefs, values, and attitudes. The more complete the audience analysis process, the more prepared the campaign planners are to tailor the messages to the specific needs and predilections of the target audience. Audience analysis can take the form of surveys, focus group discussions, or consultation of existing research results that are available and describe key aspects of the population of interest.

Formative research is the process used to guide the design and development of the campaign by gathering relevant information about the ways in which representatives of the target audience react to campaign messages. In essence, it is an early method of testing the effect of the developing campaign when changes, updates, and other refinements can still be made to reflect audience responses. Formative research can also help campaign planners make knowledgeable choices about which communication channels to use in the campaign because those channels are most likely to reach and influence the specific target audiences.

Campaign Implementation

Implementation involves the long-term administration and operation of the campaign. Campaign planners must carefully establish an effective marketing mix, which originates from the field of marketing and is indicative of the growth of social applications of marketing principles (i.e., social marketing) in public health campaigns. The marketing mix is based on product, price, placement, and promotion. In other words, campaign planners try to establish clear sets of campaign activities (products) to promote objectives that audience members can adopt with minimal economic or psychological costs (price). These objectives need to be presented in an attractive manner that is very likely to reach the target audience (placement), and the message must provide the members of the audience with information about how, when, and where they can access campaign information and programs (promotion).

Campaign planners should carefully evaluate the campaign process, which involves identifying macrosocial conditions that may influence accomplishment of the campaign goals and designing strategies for promoting long-term involvement and institutionalization of campaign activities with the target audience. Process evaluation is used to keep track and evaluate campaign activities in order to identify areas for fine-tuning campaign efforts. Since target audiences reside within and are interdependent with the larger society, campaign planners must attempt to involve these larger social systems, such as business organizations and government agencies, in the campaign activities. For example, planners for a campaign related to tobacco control used macrosocial factors to provide strong support for their efforts. They accomplished this by lobbying in support of government and corporate regulations that restricted smoking behaviors in public places and that corresponded nicely with their message strategies that encouraged people to not smoke. In this way, the macrosocial regulations on smoking supported the campaign goals of reducing smoking behaviors.

Furthermore, the campaign planner should design strategies for the long-term involvement of the audience with the goals and activities of the campaign in order to ensure that the audience members institutionalize the messages and make them a regular part of their daily lives. An excellent strategy for such institutionalization is to empower members of the target audience to get personally involved with implementing and managing campaign programs so they have a greater stake in achieving campaign goals and so the campaign activities become part of their normative cultural activities. For example, campaigns that support increased physical activity and fitness have benefited from efforts to establish annual activities, festivals, and sporting events to institutionalize their campaign goals.

Campaign Evaluation and Reorientation

The final process involved in the strategic communication campaign model is evaluation and reorientation. At this point, a summative evaluation (i.e., and evaluation of campaign outcomes) is conducted to determine the relative success of the campaign in achieving its goals at an acceptable cost, as well as to identify areas for future public health interventions. The information gathered through such outcome evaluations reorients campaign planners to the unmet health needs of the target audience. Such feedback is essential in leading campaign planners back to the first stage of the model (planning), where they identify new goals for health promotion. Through this evaluative feedback loop, the strategic communication campaign model illustrates the ongoing cyclical nature of efforts at health promotion.

Campaigns and Communication Research

As seen in the strategic communication campaign model, communication research performs a central role in strategic public health campaigns. Data are gathered (1) in the planning stage to identify consumer needs and orientations, (2) in the communication analysis stage to target specific audiences, evaluate audience message behaviors, field test messages to guide message conceptualization and development, and to identify communication channels with high audience reach, specificity, and influence, (3) in the implementation stage to monitor the progress of campaign messages and products and to determine the extent to which campaign objectives are being achieved, and (4) in the evaluation and reorientation stage to determine the overall effects of the campaign on target audiences and public health. The strategic communication campaign model suggests that to maximize the effectiveness of efforts at health promotion, research in the area of health communication must be used to guide the development, implementation, and evaluation of strategic public health campaigns.

"Chris Copeland of the Indiana Pacers was stabbed after leaving a trendy New York nightclub early Wednesday, and two Atlanta Hawks -- who had just finished a home game hours before the incident -- were among those arrested, according to police and CNN affiliates. The Hawks were not involved in the stabbing incident, police said, but were arrested on obstruction and other charges later. Though New York Police Department Det. Kelly Ort initially told CNN the incident occurred just before 4 a.m. at 1OAK, a club in New York's Chelsea neighborhood known to draw celebrities among its clientele, the club later told CNN that the stabbing occurred in front of the Fulton Houses project down the street. ""1OAK staff was unaware of the incident when it happened, as it occurred beyond their view in a different location. However, 1OAK's team assisted Mr. Copeland to their fullest capabilities, and called for help as soon as he was seen walking back towards the venue,"" the statement said. The statement continued, ""A review of the video footage seems to reveal the incident did not originate from the venue or its immediate surroundings that are under 1OAK supervision."" Copeland and a female companion, Katrine Saltara, were in the club for about 10 minutes before leaving and walking down the street toward Fulton Houses, where their car was parked, said a 1OAK spokesperson. The spokesperson gave CNN additional details on condition of anonymity because 1OAK's legal team had approved only the club's official statement. The suspect, who the spokesperson said never entered 1OAK, stabbed Copeland and Saltara in front of Fulton Houses, and according to the club's statement, ""Mr. Copeland's driver sprang to accost and detain the apparent perpetrator and that individual is now in police custody."" Charges against the suspect are pending, and his name will be released once charges are filed, Ort said. Copeland and Saltara tried to make their way back to the club to seek help from the 20 or so security personnel on hand, leaving a ""bloody trail of handprints"" between the site of the stabbing and the club, the spokesperson said. Copeland ""almost landed right next to the club,"" the spokesperson said, adding that surveillance footage will not show the actual stabbing because it occurred too far away from the club. The club shut down immediately after the incident, the spokesperson said. A male and two females were taken to area hospitals, Ort said. A knife was recovered, a suspect was arrested and two individuals not involved in the dispute -- the Hawks' Pero Antic, 32, and Thabo Sefolosha, 30 -- were arrested on charges of obstructing governmental administration and disorderly conduct, she said. Sefolosha faces an additional charge of resisting arrest, Ort said. Word of the stabbing quickly spread through the club, reaching Antic and Sefolosha, who went outside to check on their friend, Copeland, the 1OAK spokesperson said. At one point, the two began pushing their way through a crowd that had gathered around the scene, leading to their arrests, the spokesperson said. ""We will contest these charges and look forward to communicating the facts of the situation at the appropriate time,"" the players said in a joint statement released by the team. ""We apologize to our respective families, teammates, and the Hawks' organization for any negative attention this incident has brought upon them."" The Hawks are in New York for a Wednesday night game against the Brooklyn Nets. Neither player will be in uniform, the team said. Police released little information Wednesday, but local media identified the injured man as Copeland, 31, who is from Orange, New Jersey. The Pacers released a statement saying Copeland suffered a knife wound to his left elbow and abdomen, and he's in stable condition at a New York hospital. ""We are aware that Chris Copeland was injured early this morning in New York City. We are still gathering information and will update when we know more. Our thoughts are with Chris and those injured,"" Larry Bird, the Pacers' president of basketball operations, said in a statement. Copeland's agent, John Spencer, issued a statement saying, ""We're concerned about the safety of Chris and Katrine. We don't have any details at this particular time. All we can do is pray and wait."" The NBA and the Hawks front office said they were looking into the incident. ""We are aware of the situation involving Pero Antic and Thabo Sefolosha this morning. We are in the process of gathering more information and will have further comment at the appropriate time,"" Hawks spokesman Garin Narain said in an email. Copeland's Pacers are slated to play the New York Knicks on Wednesday night. The pair apparently had only recently arrived in New York prior to their arrests, as both were on the court for the Hawks' 96-69 win over the Phoenix Suns in Atlanta on Tuesday night. Antic played 12 minutes, and Sefolosha played 20. The game ended around 10 p.m. Copeland, a former Knick, was near the nightclub with Saltara when a 22-year-old Brooklyn man approached them, police told CNN affiliate WABC. There was some sort of dispute before the suspect stabbed the 6-foot-8-inch Copeland in the abdomen, slashed Saltara and then slashed another woman, the station reported. Saltara suffered cuts to her arm, breast and buttock, and the other woman suffered a slash to her stomach, CNN affiliate WCBS reported. While WCBS reported that the second woman was 53 years old, WABC reported she was 23. Images published in the New York Daily News showed a considerable amount of blood on the sidewalk and a white sports coupe, roped off with police tape, with several streaks of blood on its driver's side. Antic and Sefolosha interfered with officers trying to establish a crime scene, and one of the Hawks pushed a police officer, WABC reported. The Hawks are preparing for a historic playoff run after clinching the No. 1 seed in the NBA's Eastern Conference. Tuesday's win over the Suns marked a franchise-best 58 wins in a season for the club. The Pacers sit in the conference's 10th spot but are only one game out of playoff contention. CNN's Laura Ly, Jason Durand and Jill Martin contributed to this report.

"(Billboard)Considering the Academy of Country Music Awards celebrated its 50th anniversary on Sunday night at the Dallas Cowboys stadium, it was bound to be bigger than any previous year's ACMs. Plus, as hosts Blake Shelton and Luke Bryan were quick to point out, everything is bigger in Texas. Billboard: 2015 ACM Awards: See All the Photos. But bigger isn't always better. Here's our breakdown of the 10 best and 5 worst moments at the 2015 ACMs. The Best. Eric Church & Keith Urban provide an opening wallop. With a full stadium and millions of home viewers watching, two of country's leading men successfully lit the fuse for the 50th annual ACM Awards with a slick joint kickoff performance. Eric Church's ""Pledge Allegiance To The Hag"" was a fine throwback, but Keith Urban's powerhouse ""Raise 'Em Up"" lived up to its title -- and then some. Setting a Guinness World Record. Not only was this the ACMs biggest audience ever, but the 2015 ACM Awards brought in the biggest audience for a live TV awards show ever. Now that's how you celebrate half a century. Reba McEntire demonstrates how it's done. During a night that found a couple performers sounding a little weak in the vocal department, Reba McEntire showed the entire Cowboys stadium -- and many younger singers who don't have half her energy -- how it's done. Reba is eternal. Taylor Swift singing in the audience. Whether it was during Eric Church or Martina McBride, T-Swift was heating up the audience by singing and swaying along to country staples. Taylor might have gone pop for ""1989,"" but she was deep in the heart of Texas for this annual country extravaganza. Billboard: 2015 ACM Awards: And the Winners Are... Garth Brooks' All-American salute. During Brooks' performance of ""All-American Kid,"" the country giant welcomed a slew of U.S. military representatives into AT&T Stadium, in an emotional moment that put the red, white and blue front and center. Brooks ended the performance by saluting the U.S. armed forces ""who are here and are all around the world for protecting our freedom,"" and also shouted out his home state of Oklahoma, who are grieving 20 years after the Oklahoma City bombing on Sunday. A truly classy moment from one of the best ever. Taylor Swift's mom makes an appearance. Sure, Andrea Swift's presentation of a special award for her daughter came with a fun origin tale about the creation of ""Love Story"" and some lovely words about the 25-year-old superstar. But the sight of the elder Swift -- just days after Taylor confirmed that her mother had been diagnosed with cancer -- walking to the podium was more than enough to yield one of the night's most poignant moments. Christina Aguilera joins Rascal Flatts. Aguilera is far from country, but with a voice as malleable as hers, she can pass for a song or two. After singing a bit of the tune she did while guesting on Nashville, Xtina joined longtime hitmakers Rascal Flatts for ""Riot"" from their recent album ""Rewind."" Aguilera and Gary LeVox trading vocals was the rare unexpected artist pairing that actually worked. Miranda Lambert domination. In addition to kicking ass during her ""Mama's Broken Heart""/""Little Red Wagon"" medley, Lambert justly owned the night when it came to awards. If there's one thing the country community loves more than Miranda Lambert, it's giving Miranda Lambert awards. Billboard: Watch Little Big Town Bring Provocative 'Girl Crush' to ACMs. Little Big Town don't back down. Despite some mild controversy over their song ""Girl Crush,"" Little Big Town brought the poignant ballad to the awards show, giving the ACMs one of its more melancholy moments. Jason Aldean comes on strong. For a night featuring some shaky vocals, Aldean brought his silky yet powerful country croon to the ACMs during a massive medley. It's hard to see an audience get weak in the knees when you're watching at home, but it's fair to assume that's what happened during his performance. The Worst. Tony Romo. The Dallas Cowboys QB was understandably a little stiff on the mic (athletes usually aren't the most charismatic public speakers) but the whole gag with Shelton asking Romo to toss Bryan a pass went on waaaaay too long. On the plus side, Bryan caught the pass. On the other hand, there was a tired play on words about balls. The length. Three hours for the 50th ACMs? Sure, why not. Three and a half hours? That's pushing it. They could have shaved off the last half hour by cutting a couple of the performers who only sang half a song, and shortened a few of the massive commercial breaks. All of the Milestone Awards. Taylor Swift was given an extended honor at this year's ACM Awards, but some of the Milestone Awards -- especially those given to Reba McEntire, Kenny Chesney and George Strait -- seemed rushed for the country giants they were saluting. It's understandable since 2015 is the 50th anniversary of the ACMs, but sometimes, less (recipients) is more. Steven Tyler's facial hair. See link. Twitter calling out Taylor Swift. Plenty of country fans went after T-Swizzle on Twitter, berating her for attending the ACMs after ""abandoning"" country music for pop. The truth is, Swift has just as many country classics under her belt as any other artist in her age range. She might have moved to pop, but don't underplay her importance to the genre that birthed her. ©2015 Billboard. All Rights Reserved.

"STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Next, we're going to talk about an uneasy alliance in the fight over gun control. The gun industry makes weapons. The National Rifle Association is a leading voice for gun rights. They share common interests, of course, but it's emerging that they may not always have the same opinions about fighting the change in gun laws.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Paul Barrett of Bloomberg Businessweek has been talking with gun makers.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: What is it you think has been overlooked about the - whatever you want to call it - the gun lobby, the gun industry, gun rights advocates, what did you discover?
PAUL BARRETT: It's becoming almost conventional wisdom that the reason the NRA goes to such extremes is that it is driven by the gun industry. And in fact, that understanding is just incorrect. If anything, it is the NRA that sets the terms of the debate and the gun industry basically obediently follows along.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: What are some things that the National Rifle Association has said in recent months that have caused people in the gun industry who talked to you to cringe?
PAUL BARRETT: Well, the most specific thing has been the series of performances by Wayne LaPierre, the CEO and longtime head of the NRA, who has taken the group to what I would describe as a new extreme in terms of its pugnacious stance in the wake of the Newtown Elementary School massacre. And I think many people in the gun industry, given a choice, would not take the conspiratorial sort of paranoid approach that LaPierre specializes in. That said, they are doing nothing to try to deter him - for two reasons. One, they're afraid of the consumer boycotts that the NRA can organize if it chooses. And two, the NRA's hype actually does benefit the gun industry.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Is that a real possibility, that the NRA could organize a boycott of Smith & Wesson or some other brand of firearm?
PAUL BARRETT: It's not just a real possibility; it's something that has happened in the past. In 2000, which really was the last time before the current round of debate that we had a live gun control debate at the national level. Smith and Wesson actually tried to step up and arrive at a truce with the Clinton administration and with government officials around the country who were suing the gun industry. And Smith & Wesson agreed to settle those lawsuits and to comply with an unprecedented level of regulation. The result of that was that the NRA, other gun rights groups, encouraged gun buyers to boycott Smith & Wesson. In the space of six to eight months, the company almost went out of business. Plants were shut down, production lines were closed, and ultimately, the company changed ownership, reneged on the settlement and was accepted back into the fold. This is not a theoretical possibility. This is what happens when you cross the NRA.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Are there specific reforms - if we want to call them that - that gun manufacturers would sign on to if the NRA was not in the way of them doing so?
PAUL BARRETT: It's more question of whether they would object. One of the main proposals pending before Congress, and in fact, the White House has identified this as its top priority, is to make the background check system comprehensive, so that it would be legally required for all gun transactions to go through some type of computerized background check.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Mm-hmm.
PAUL BARRETT: In fact, the gun industry is basically agnostic on that point. It's not that they're going to stand up and cheer in favor of it, but almost their entire stock and trade is already done through the licensed background check system. So the gun industry would just basically stand by and say very little if it were purely up to them. But they're not going to stand up and get into a fight with Wayne LaPierre in public.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Paul Barrett of Bloomberg Businessweek, thanks very much.
PAUL BARRETT: My pleasure. Thanks for having me.

"Lauren Hill, who took her inspirational fight against brain cancer onto the basketball court and into the hearts of many, has died at age 19. The Indiana woman's story became known around the world last year when she was able to realize her dream of playing college basketball. Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati successfully petitioned the NCAA to move up the opening game of its schedule to accommodate her desire to play. Hill died early Friday. At a ceremony honoring her life on the school's campus Friday afternoon, head coach Dan Benjamin said the toughest thing a coach has to deal with is a loss. The community had lost more than a player, he said. It lost a friend and a daughter. And it lost ""an unselfish angel."" ""It's not often you get to celebrate a loss,"" he told the crowd as he struggled to hold in his tears. ""But today we celebrate a victory on how to live a life, through Lauren Hill. (No.) 22 you will be missed and remembered by so many."" An assistant coach read a quote from Hill:. ""I encourage everyone to cherish every moment with no worry about the past or anxiety about the future. Because the next moment is never promised. Never leave anything unsaid. I have learned to see the blessings in every moment and through every struggle, no matter how tough it might be. Nothing holds me back from living my life and chasing my dreams. I always finish what I start and see it through to the end. Never give up on your dreams. Find something to fight for; I fight for others."" Hill would go on to help raise $1.4 million for pediatric cancer research with the nonprofit group The Cure Starts Now. The organization called her a ""worldwide inspiration."" ""Lauren captured the hearts of people worldwide with her tenacity and determination to play in her first collegiate basketball game with her Mount St. Joseph University team,"" the group said on Facebook. People we've lost in 2015. Mount St. Joseph University President Tony Artez said Hill's ""love and laughter will remain in our hearts."" ""We are forever grateful to have had Lauren grace our campus with her smile and determined spirit,"" Artez said in a statement. ""She has left a powerful legacy. She taught us that every day is a blessing, every moment a gift."" Her principal at Lawrenceburg High School, Bill Snyder, announced her death to students Friday morning. ""Lauren's message was constantly positive,"" he told CNN. ""We all need to work together to beat obstacles. Not just cancer. In any situation we can be positive."" As news of her death spread, social media lit up with messages honoring her life. NBA great LeBron James called her the ""true definition of strength, courage, power, leadership."" ""The greatest accomplishment we can achieve as humans is to inspire many,"" Twitter user Just_AP wrote. ""Lauren Hill did that."" NCAA President Mark Emmert said Hill's ""enthusiasm and strength were an inspiration not only to those who knew her best, but also to the millions of people she touched around the world by sharing her story."" ""Lauren achieved a lasting and meaningful legacy, and her beautiful spirit will continue to live on,"" he said in a statement. Hill was diagnosed with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma in 2013 when she was a senior in high school. The rare brain tumor was inoperable, but Hill persisted in playing on her high school team despite chemotherapy treatments. ""I never gave up for a second, even when I got a terminal diagnosis, never thought about sitting back and not living life anymore,"" she told CNN affiliate WKRC-TV at the time. She had already committed to play for Mount St. Joseph when she was diagnosed. In October, the school received permission from the NCAA to move up its first scheduled game so Hill could play. In front of a sellout crowd, many wearing T-shirts bearing her name and slogan, ""Never Give Up,"" watched the ballplayer score the first two points and the final layup of the game. ""Today has been the best day I've ever had,"" Hill told the crowd after the game. ""I don't know what to say but thank you."" CNN's Jill Martin, Emanuella Grinberg and Faith Karimi contributed to this report.

"Method that converts a mixture or solution into two or more distinct products

A separation process is a method that converts a mixture or a solution of chemical substances into two or more distinct product mixtures, [1] a scientific process of separating two or more substance in order to obtain purity. At least one product mixture from the separation is enriched in one or more of the source mixture's constituents. In some cases, a separation may fully divide the mixture into pure constituents. Separations exploit differences in chemical properties or physical properties (such as size, shape, mass, density, or chemical affinity) between the constituents of a mixture.

Processes are often classified according to the particular properties they exploit to achieve separation. If no single difference can be used to accomplish the desired separation, multiple operations can often be combined to achieve the desired end.

With a few exceptions, elements or compounds exist in nature in an impure state. Often these raw materials must go through a separation before they can be put to productive use, making separation techniques essential for the modern industrial economy.

The purpose of separation may be:

analytical : to identify the size of each fraction of a mixture is attributable to each component without attempting to harvest the fractions.

: to identify the size of each fraction of a mixture is attributable to each component without attempting to harvest the fractions. preparative: to ""prepare"" fractions for input into processes that benefit when components are separated.

Separations may be performed on a small scale, as in a laboratory for analytical purposes, or on a large scale, as in a chemical plant.

Complete and incomplete separation [ edit ]

Some types of separation require complete purification of a certain component. An example is the production of aluminum metal from bauxite ore through electrolysis refining. In contrast, an incomplete separation process may specify an output to consist of a mixture instead of a single pure component. A good example of an incomplete separation technique is oil refining. Crude oil occurs naturally as a mixture of various hydrocarbons and impurities. The refining process splits this mixture into other, more valuable mixtures such as natural gas, gasoline and chemical feedstocks, none of which are pure substances, but each of which must be separated from the raw crude.

In both complete separation and incomplete separation, a series or cascade of separations may be necessary to obtain the desired end products. In the case of oil refining, crude is subjected to a long series of individual distillation steps, each of which produces a different product or intermediate.

List of separation techniques [ edit ]

Crystallization

Decantation

Demister (vapor), removes liquid droplets from gas streams

Distillation, used for mixtures of liquids with different boiling points

Drying, removes liquid from a solid by vaporization or evaporation

Electrophoresis, separates organic molecules based on their different interaction with a gel under an electric potential (i.e., different travel) Capillary electrophoresis



Electrostatic separation, works on the principle of corona discharge, where two plates are placed close together and high voltage is applied. This high voltage is used to separate the ionized particles.

Elutriation

Evaporation

"TITLE: After years of near-extinction, the whacky Rhino party is back - The Globe and Mail  PUBLISHER: 140961138903  PUBLISHED DATETIME: 2018-04-26T06:53:41.519Z Skip to main content # After years of near-extinction, the whacky Rhino party is back Ingrid Peritz MONTREAL Published August 8, 2007 Updated April 26, 2018 Comments Canada's Rhinoceros Party, the political beast devoted to bringing a smile to the Canadian body politic, says it's on the road back from extinction. The party that once promised to repeal the law of gravity and keep none of its promises plans to run a candidate in the federal by-election in Montreal's Outremont riding next month. Among the party's early planks: renaming our country Nantucket and abolishing lawn-mowing in Outremont. Story continues below advertisement The announcements came from not one but two Rhino herds that emerged from the political wilderness this week. Yesterday, Ontario native and Rhino stalwart Brian Salmi filed a lawsuit in Federal Court challenging Canada's election reform law, hoping to strike down the $1,000 deposit for federal candidates so he can afford to run for office. At a press scrum outside the Federal Court in Montreal, at which he was dressed as a clown, he immediately pledged to change the name of Canada if elected. ""We have a grave concern that Canada is seen as a definitely dull country in the rest of the world,"" he said, straight-faced. ""We seek to correct that misconception by changing the name to Nantucket."" He is not the only aspirant seeking to restore humour to the federal scene and capitalize on the dearth of political news during the dog days of August. In a separate initiative, another Rhino group in Quebec announced its revival yesterday. Dubbed the Neorhino Party, the group held a fundraiser last fall and has submitted 500 signatures to Elections Canada to register its party. A spokesman for Elections Canada confirmed the party is in the process of registering. The group, led by Montreal artist and former Rhino candidate François Gourd, went to a game park near Montreal and posed in front of a penned, real-life rhinoceros to announce its return to the federal scene. Mr. Gourd wants to run under the Neorhino banner in Outremont. Story continues below advertisement The two groups say they were unaware of one another's initiatives, as befitting a ""disorganized and anarchic"" movement, but they plan to meet in a Montreal bar tomorrow to discuss a merger. Their reappearance aims to revive a party that helped enliven politics from 1963 to 1988 with an absurdist take on Canadian affairs. The party says it picked a rhino as its mascot since, like politicians, the animal is thick-skinned, slow-moving and dim-witted. Among its planks was flattening the Rockies, banning guns and butter since both killed, and improving higher education by building taller schools. Behind their latest antics, however, they say they're drawing attention to some serious issues. Mr. Salmi says the $1,000 deposit required by the federal Elections Act is a deterrent for lower-income Canadians, and violates the Charter. ""It's a de facto economic means test that discriminates against the poor,"" said Mr. Salmi, a Montreal resident who has sought office on nine previous occasions, several of them in British Columbia. (Mr. Salmi has legally changed his name to Sa Tan, so his challenge in Federal Court reads Sa Tan against Her Majesty The Queen.) The Rhinoceros Party last ran in a general federal election in 1988, fielding 74 candidates. None was elected, and the nascent groups say they're intent on matching that abysmal performance. Mr. Salmi, for example, has no organization behind him. Mr. Gourd, who hopes to run candidates across Canada, says his ambition is to come in dead last in the Sept. 17 by-election. ""We're aiming to be the party with the fewest votes,"" he said. ""That way, we'll be No. 1 starting from the bottom."" Story continues below advertisement POLITICS THE RHINOS EXPLAINED The wild party Who they are The party was founded by Montreal physician, author and noted wit Jacques Ferron in 1963. Asked once what his candidates would do if elected, Dr. Ferron replied: ""The same as yours - nothing."" The name springs from a prank pulled in Brazil in the late 1950s, when several reporters entered a rhinoceros in a Sao Paulo municipal election with the intention of cleaning up civic corruption. The rhino won. The Rhinoceros Party's original leader was Cornelius I, a rhinoceros foaled in Quebec's Granby Zoo. It was later traded to the San Diego Zoo for a giraffe. Story continues below advertisement The party's best showing was the 1980 federal election, when they garnered 110,597 votes, 1.01 per cent of the popular vote. What they've promised A dam on the St. Lawrence to make Montreal the Venice of North America; A tax on milk to finance the appointment of Rhino followers to a new Ontario senate; A 400-kilometre fishing limit to be drawn offshore in watercolour, to make sure the fish could see it and stay inside the Canadian boundary; A Guaranteed Annual Orgasm through a network of regulated brothels; Story continues below advertisement To repeal the law of gravity (promised by Rhinos in 1984); A proposal for free trade with the United States: ""Trade Frank Zappa for Pierre Berton, Kermit the Frog for Lorne Greene, and we were prepared to put Anne Murray on the bargaining table.""

"Adlingfleet, Adlingfleet Drainage, 1927 Upgrade: After periodic flooding in the 1920s, a survey was made, indicating that the fall on the main drain was around 2 inches per mile (30 mm per km), which was not sufficient for good drainage by gravity. Based on the premise that a pumping scheme had an annual cost for running and maintenance, whereas lowering the cill was essentially a one-time cost, the Commissioners of the Adlingfleet and Whitgift Drainage Board asked for tenders for a new sluice in December 1926. The cill would be 2.5 feet (0.76 m) lower than the existing one, and the contract was for construction of the sluice and work on the drain itself, to make it wider and deeper. Near the sluice, the channel would be 75 feet (23 m) wide at the top, 12 feet (3.7 m) wide at the bottom and 20.5 feet (6.2 m) deep. Decreasing sizes were specified for six sections over its 4-mile (6.4 km) length, with the final section being 10 feet (3.0 m) wide at the bottom and only 1.83 feet (0.56 m) deep. Various bridges would need their foundations lowered and other improvements to be made, while Gill's Close bridge was to be dismantled and not replaced.",The average gutter has a width of 2 feet.,0,0,0.01652713678777218

I thought the Mac and cheese was a little dry/bland but with a little salt and pepper on it, it helped. I thought the potato salad with bacon was pretty good but needed something acidic to break down all the starchiness.

To be fair i warned them when they were kids: your uncle is going to expect to be paid back for all the driving, picking up, leaving off, etc., etc., i did for you. So NOW is that time.\nBut for now i am relishing the well earned attention. And i'm only 1/2 kidding here in any event.\nSeveral weeks ago my niece told me about Neighbor Tim's both as a food truck and a stand alone BBQ joint.\nI zipped into SB and asked her to bring some BBQ for me, her kids and hubby as well as for my sisters. She raved about this place. So i thought: ok, sounds good: so bring me some, please.\nWell bring me some she did:\nPork ribs\nBrisket\nPotato Salad\nMac and cheese\nWhite Bread thick sliced\nSauce: Amazing Sauce it is called\nBurnt Ends (from another time but reviewed here)\nThe ribs were perfectly cooked and meaty. I am a purist when it comes to ribs. they must be tender and juicy but not falling off the bone meaning i pick one up and the meat falls off. That is too well cooked, usually cooked with too much moisture and not enough heat or smoke.\nThese ribs though were well smoked, well seasoned (not too salty) and were delivered w/o sauce which is the way i prefer them so that you can taste the meat and not just the sauce. The sauce btw is super also: vinegary, light on the sugars with a snappy chili finish: north carolina style which surprised me only because i thought this was a Texas style BBQ joint. But it works so why fight it. \nThe Brisket was also well seasoned and smoked as well as very moist and tender. No knife needed to cut and we made sammys using the white bread and dipping in the sauce to finish.\nThe Mac and cheese is nothing special: just cheese sauce and noodles. This needed salt and pepper for starters. \nThe potato salad was a big letdown also: the dressing was good and in the right proportion: neither too much or not enough but again salt and pepper would have helped and acid is needed desperately. Pickles, mustard, maybe or both?  Also most damning is that the potatoes were slightly undercooked. in other words too al dente for my taste. \nThick white bread was in the Texas toast style and it was real tasty: reminded me of a traditional pullman loaf. Yeasty, high quality bread not Wonder Bread, remember?\nThe burnt ends were not part of this order but we had these about 4 weeks ago and they were absolutely first rate: charred, and well seasoned to within an inch of their lives. Tim's are made from the deckle of the brisket i am going to assume and are super tasty chunks of beefy goodness. Next day you can thinly slice and use in a taco or sammy or just to pop in your mouth while pretending to grab a beer from the refer.\nAll in all a very good sampling today of Neighbor Tim's wares:  what they do well they do very, very well.

"survey studies have offered insights about the ways learners who fit these two categories tend to vary in their assessment of goals, the goals they see as relevant or salient, and the ways in which their goals relate to other phenomena such as school achievement (King and McInerney, 2016). For example, in cross-cultural studies of academic goals, Dekker and Fischer (2008) found that gaining social approval in achievement contexts was particularly important for students who had a collectivist perspective. This cultural value may predispose students to adopt goals that help them to avoid the appearance of incompetence or negative judgments (i.e., performance-avoidance goals) (Elliot, 1997, 1999; Kitayama, Matsumoto, and Norasakkunkit, 1997).

More recent work has also explored the relationships between such differences and cultural context.

"This exciting new volume will provide a comprehensive overview of the applications of geoinformatics technology for engineers, scientists, and students to become more productive, more aware, and more responsive to global climate change issues and how to manage sustainable development of Earth's resources.

Over the last few years, the stress on natural resources has increased enormously due to anthropogenic activities especially through urbanization and industrialization processes. Sustainable development while protecting the Earth's environment involves the best possible management of natural resources, subject to the availability of reliable, accurate and timely information on regional and global scales. There is an increasing demand for an interdisciplinary approach and sound knowledge on each specific resource, as well as on the ecological and socio-economic perspectives related to their use.

Geoinformatics, including Remote Sensing (RS), Geographical Information System (GIS), and Global Positioning System (GPS), is a groundbreaking and advanced technology for acquiring information required for natural resource management and addressing the concerns related to sustainable development. It offers a powerful and proficient tool for mapping, monitoring, modeling, and management of natural resources. There is, however, a lack of studies in understanding the core science and research elements of geoinformatics, as well as larger issues of scaling to use geoinformatics in sustainable development and management practices of natural resources. There is also a fundamental gap between the theoretical concepts and the operational use of these advance techniques.

Sustainable Development Practices Using Geoinformatics, written by well-known academicians, experts and researchers provides answers to these problems, offering the engineer, scientist, or student the most thorough, comprehensive, and practical coverage of this subject available today, a must-have for any library.", Geoinformatics is a groundbreaking and advanced technology for acquiring information required for natural resource management and addressing the concerns related to sustainable development.,1,1,0.9872196912765503

The 25-year-old has been a vital part in Pep Guardiola's style of football at the Etihad. The Brazilian is set to improve on the 17 clean sheets he collected last season and seems sure to play a prominent role for years to come at Manchester City. ### Trent Alexander-Arnold (RB - Liverpool) Alexander-Arnold exploded on to the domestic scene last season and has built on those displays this term, performing admirably in Liverpool's Premier League title charge, as well as opening his goalscoring account for England in November. The 20-year-old academy graduate has excelled under Jürgen Klopp with his pinpoint crossing accuracy and superb defensive work, the latter helping Liverpool's defence become one of the meanest in the Premier League. ### Virgil van Dijk (CB - Liverpool) The all-action Dutch defender has been outstanding for Liverpool throughout this campaign as the defensive rock in a back four who are well on their way to 20 clean sheets for the Premier League season. As well as his superb performances in helping keep the ball out of Liverpool's net , Van Dijk has chipped in with some important goals, and launched moves that have led to goals with his raking long passes. ### Aymeric Laporte (CB - Manchester City) The January 2018 signing has excelled in his first full season at the Etihad Stadium as City look to clinch a second successive Premier League title. The 24-year-old Frenchman has excelled in a team with over a dozen clean sheets this season. The former Athletic Bilbao defender's combative style and composure on the ball are hallmarks of Pep Guardiola's team. ### Andrew Robertson (LB - Liverpool) The former Dundee United and Hull City full-back has become a cult hero amongst the Anfield faithful, and he has been a linchpin in the Liverpool side as they search for a maiden Premier League title, his rapid bursts up and down the left fl ank highlighting his energetic style. The 24-year-old Scotland captain has notched up more assists than any other defender in the Premier League this campaign via his astute passing and pinpoint crossing. ### Paul Pogba (MF - Manchester United) A World Cup winner last summer, Pogba has enjoyed the best goalscoring season of his career, racking up over a dozen goals as United battle for a Champions League spot. Possessing stunning ballstriking and passing abilities with both feet, along with a tremendous work rate, the 26-year-old has thrived under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and can be expected to have a stellar end to the 2018-19 campaign. ### Fernandinho (MF - Manchester City) The combative Brazilian has played a crucial role in Manchester City's success over the last six seasons, his no-nonsense approach being matched by a delightful passing ability and creativity. As he approaches 200 league appearances in England, the 33-year-old can boast two Premier League titles as well as four League Cups and he will be in the hunt for more domestic and European success. ### Bernardo Silva (MF - Manchester City) Whether operating as a No.10, out wide or in midfield, Bernardo Silva has been immense for City this season. He has taken his opportunities this season becoming a regular fixture in citys starting eleven delivering outstanding performances. His famous 13.7km performance in the 2-1 defeat of Liverpool in January typified the Lisbon-born star's attitude and work rate. ""There's nowhere else I want to be,"" he said, after signing a new deal last month. ### Raheem Sterling (FW - Manchester City) Manchester City and England's speedster has had another fabulous campaign under Pep Guardiola, racking up more than a dozen goals to help his club in the thrilling Premier League title battle. Fast becoming a model of consistency anywhere in the defending champions' forward line, Sterling has earned praise from England boss Gareth Southgate, who has described his season so far as ""phenomenal"". ### Sergio AgUero (FW - Manchester City) The prolific Argentina striker has secured a place in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year after another tremendous campaign as Manchester City's leading marksman. Back-to-back Premier League hat-tricks against Arsenal and Chelsea launched the 30-year-old into Golden Boot contention, a prize he is looking to win for a second time, and his deadly marksmanship could well be the crucial factor in this season's title race. ### Sadio ManE (FW - Liverpool) A vital member of Liverpool's outstanding attacking trio, Mané has earned a second PFA Premier League Team of the Year nomination in three seasons after a campaign marked by decisive goals for the Anfi eld club. With a Champions League brace in the Allianz Arena against Bayern Munich, as well as strikes against Arsenal and Manchester United under his belt, the Senegalese attacker will no doubt have a major role to play as Liverpool aim to win a fi rst league title since 1990. ### In the news... #### Players at risk as clubs ignore injury link to mental health News posted: 22/08/2019 Junior Agogo dies aged 40 Wigan athletic players attend fit and fed session Conor Wilkinson and Lee Angol make community debut Manchester United's 'Class of 92' to open university View all news ## PFA Latest News PFA Awards ## Membership 4 the Player Joining the PFA ## Health 24/7/365 Helpline Behavioural Rehab Dementia Support Injury Rehab Counsellor Network ## Transition Coaching Directory Jobs in Football On the Board ## Social Media","He was also named in the PFA Team of the Year alongside Liverpool teammates, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Andrew Robertson and van Dijk.",1,0,0.014539576135575771
"Boston (CNN)After weeks of dramatic and emotionally wrenching testimony in the Boston Marathon bombing trial, jurors deliberated for more than seven hours Tuesday. But they haven't reached a verdict yet. The jurors sent out two questions, which are scheduled to be addressed when they return to court Wednesday morning. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the 21-year-old accused Boston Marathon bomber, faces life in prison or the death penalty. On Monday, the jury saw a video of the moment a bomb exploded and disemboweled an 8-year-old boy and ripped the leg off his sister. The blast killed a 23-year-old graduate student from China. The jurors heard more horror from April 15, 2013. At one point, prosecutors played a video that showed the scene after a bomb exploded -- blood and injured victims everywhere and the sounds of a child howling. His mother lost her leg. ""The defendant brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty said. ""The defendant thought that his values were more important than the people around him. He wanted to awake the mujahedeen, the holy warriors, so he chose Patriots' Day, Marathon Monday,"" a time for families to gather and watch the marathon. Tsarnaev's defense attorney Judy Clarke tried to persuade jurors that her client's older brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died in a shootout with police days after the terror attack, was the instigator of the marathon plot. The younger man, Clarke said, was only following his older brother. ""If not for Tamerlan, it would not have happened,"" Clarke argued. Bomb survivors and victims' family members wiped away tears and comforted one another in court. Tsarnaev fidgeted at the defense table as he has done throughout the trial. Bill Richard, father of bomb victim Martin Richard, 8, craned his neck to watch Tsarnaev as the prosecutor spoke. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev ""chose a day when the eyes of the world would be on Boston,"" Chakravarty said. ""He chose a day when there would be civilians on the sidewalks, and he targeted those civilians: men, women and children."" The lawyer waited a beat. ""He wanted to terrorize this country. He wanted to punish America for what it was doing to his people."" The prosecutor showed a picture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, in the marathon crowd. The day of the bombings, Chakravarty said, ""they felt they were soldiers. They were the mujahedeen and they were bringing their battle to Boston."" Tsarnaev is accused of 30 counts, including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism. Seventeen of those counts carry a sentence of death or life imprisonment. If Tsarnaev is found guilty of at least one of the 17 capital counts, the trial will proceed to a second phase, the so-called penalty phase. That part of the trial will include evidence of aggravating and mitigating factors, and the jury will be asked to weigh elements that make this crime especially heinous against details from Tsarnaev's background and mental health history that would weigh in his favor. Since testimony began March 4, federal prosecutors have called 92 witnesses, and the defense just four. It seemed a mismatch from the start. ""He was there,"" Clarke conceded as the trial opened, but the defense strategy always had been to focus on persuading the jury to spare Tsarnaev's life. Jurors were shown a photo of Tsarnaev standing by a tree behind the family of Martin Richard. ""These children weren't innocent to him,"" the prosecutor said. ""They were American. He knew what that bag was designed to do."" Chakravarty quoted Martin's father who earlier testified, ""I guess we were just unlucky that day."" But luck had nothing to do with the Boston bombings, the prosecutor said. ""This was a cold, intentional, terrorist act,"" he said. The brothers' acts that day were intended, he said, ""to make a point. To tell America, 'We won't be terrorized by you anymore. We will terrorize you.' "" The defense has maintained that Tsarnaev, who was 19 and flunking out of college at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, fell under the sway of his older, more radicalized brother. ""In the past few weeks, we have come face to face with tragedy, suffering and grief in dimensions none of us could imagine,"" Clarke said. ""We've heard words, we've heard screams and we've heard cries. For this suffering and pain, there is no excuse."" She acknowledged her client participated in a ""senseless act."" Tamerlan Tsarnaev, a Golden Gloves boxer, had hoped to wage jihad, and his slacker younger brother was just along for the ride, the defense has maintained. During the 15-minute rebuttal period, prosecutor William Weinreb told jurors not to be distracted by the defense's ""attempt to point the finger at somebody else."" ""There should be no doubt in your mind that the defendant and his brother are equally guilty,"" he said. They were ""partners in crime."" Weinreb pointed out that after the bombing, Tsarnaev went to the grocery store. ""Tamerlan Tsarnaev didn't turn his brother into a murderer. To shred the bodies of women and children with a homemade type of bomb, you have to be different from other people,"" the prosecutor said. ""If you are capable of such hate, such callousness that you can murder and maim 20 people and then drive to Whole Foods and buy some milk, can you really blame it on your brother?"" The radicalization of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. From the start, prosecutors presented a compelling case in which the horrors of April 15 to 19, 2013, were vividly brought to life once again. They began with the stories of bombing survivors and first responders, who described acts of courage and compassion amid madness and chaos. The final moments of the three Boston Marathon spectators who died were recounted by the people who were by their sides. According to testimony, Tamerlan Tsarnaev set off a bomb made from a 6-quart pressure cooker, explosive powder from fireworks, duct tape, nails and BBs on Boylston Street near the finish line. That bomb, which exploded near Marathon Sports, claimed the life of Krystle Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant manager. Twelve seconds later, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev allegedly detonated a second, similar bomb outside the Forum restaurant, slightly more than a block away. That blast killed the boy, Martin Richard, and Lingzi Lu, 23, a graduate student from China. Chakravarty's voice grew soft Monday as he recalled the victims:. Martin's 69-pound body ""was shattered, broken, eviscerated, burned. There wasn't a part of this boy's body that wasn't destroyed."" Lu ""received blast injuries all over her body. Her leg was torn open, and she bled out."" Campbell died in less than a minute from ""massive blast injuries to her lower extremities. Parts of her body were shredded."" Sean Collier, the MIT campus police officer killed three days after the bombings, ""never had a chance."" He was shot between the eyes. ""They assassinated him."" The brothers allegedly killed the 26-year-old officer for his service weapon but couldn't pry it loose from a safety holster. Case ends with grisly photos and testimony. Dun Meng told the jury about his frightening 90 minutes with two carjackers, one who admitted being involved in the marathon bombing. He identified that person as Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Police fired 210 rounds at the brothers when they tracked a GPS device in Meng's stolen Mercedes and cornered them in Watertown, Massachusetts. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev struck Tamerlan, who was wounded, when he charged police in the car. Tamerlan died of his injuries. ""Tamerlan wanted suicide by cop,"" the prosecutor said Monday. ""He was ready for heaven. But the defendant had other plans."" Dzhokhar ditched the stolen car and sought shelter in a dry-docked boat parked in a trailer in a backyard in Watertown. As he hid, he used a pencil to scrawl what prosecutors called a ""manifesto"" in which he said he was jealous of his brother for dying as a martyr and reaching paradise. He also lashed out at the United States for policies he said killed Muslims, writing, ""I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished. We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all."" Federal prosecutors also presented evidence gleaned from searches of the brothers' computers, including militant literature written by top al Qaeda leaders. And they traced the purchase of the pressure cookers, ammunition and BBs, which appeared to have been made by Tamerlan. Boston trial: What defense?

"BLITZER: Tonight, House Democrats are accusing President Trump of committing multiple federal crimes, including bribery, even though they were not explicitly referenced in the articles of impeachment. We're joined now by Democratic Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, a member of both the Intelligence and Oversight committees. Congressman, thanks so much for joining us.
REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): Thank you.
BLITZER: And let's walk through what the House of Representatives is about to do. They will take a historic vote to impeach the president on Wednesday. Walk us through what will happen.
KRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, as you know, there are two articles of impeachment, one for abuse of power and the other for obstruction of Congress. And so there will be a vote on these articles. Obviously, I don't think that the speaker is doing anything other than directing people to vote per their conscience and their constituents. And I think that's what people are going to do on Wednesday.
BLITZER: Your Republican colleague Will Hurd of Texas says, you can vote against impeachment, but still disagree with some of the president's behavior. How do you respond to that?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I respectfully disagree with my colleague, in the sense that this type of behavior is precisely why the framers of the Constitution incorporated an impeachment provision within the Constitution. The framers were deeply concerned about foreign powers getting involved in the domestic affairs of America. And, specifically, they would have been extremely concerned about pressuring a foreign power or getting a foreign power to get involved in our elections. In this particular case, that's exactly what the evidence shows that the president, over a pattern of -- over several months exhibited a pattern of conduct in which he pressured the Ukrainians to basically investigate his political rivals, thereby compromising national security and the integrity of our elections, Wolf.
BLITZER: What does it say to you, Congressman, that not a single Republican in the House is expected to vote for either of these articles of impeachment?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, as you know, Justin Amash, I guess, was a Republican before he disagreed with the president. I think that he will probably vote in favor of the articles. That being said, at this point, I think everyone has to vote their conscience and has to do the right thing and put the Constitution above party and politics. That's extremely important.
BLITZER: Should Justin Amash, who is now an independent member of the House, serve as an impeachment case manager, a manager in the course of the trial in the Senate, as some of your Democratic colleagues are recommending?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't want to speculate on who the manager is going to be. I know that Nancy Pelosi is going to assemble a team that knows the facts and brings credit to the House in presenting the case in the Senate.
BLITZER: In an interview, a new interview, as we have been reporting, in “The New Yorker“ magazine, Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, made this admission about his campaign to push out the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. He says this. He says: “I believed that I needed Yovanovitch out of the way. She was going to make the investigations difficult for everybody.“ So, what do you think? How significant is that admission by Giuliani?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I think it's very significant. And that's what the evidence showed during the hearings, that Rudy Giuliani and the president basically pushed Ambassador Yovanovitch away to basically install Rudy Giuliani in charge of Ukraine policy, along with the three amigos, Ambassador Sondland, Rick Perry and Volker, Ambassador Volker. And, basically, what they sought to do was to basically commandeer Ukraine policy in favor of Donald Trump's political ambitions. And, as I said before, that's a shadow foreign policy. That is not necessarily in the best interests of the country, but maybe in the best interest of Rudy Giuliani's clients and Donald Trump's political agenda. But that's not the way that our foreign policy should ever be run.
BLITZER: Should Giuliani be called as a witness?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't know. We have never received the documents that were subpoenaed from Giuliani. I personally -- I'm speaking for myself. I personally believe that we should always view documents from a witness before they are examined in terms of their live testimony. And so I'd like to see those documents first.
BLITZER: Congressman Krishnamoorthi, thanks so much for joining us.
KRISHNAMOORTHI: Thank you so much.
BLITZER: All right, just ahead, we're going to have much more on Rudy Giuliani unplugged when it comes to Ukraine. Why is he apparently admitting he wanted the former U.S. ambassador ousted, so he could freely dig up dirt for the -- on the Bidens? Plus, after two crashes, why is Boeing now halting, halting production of the 737 MAX?",Giuliani pushed out the ambassador and took control of Ukraine policy with others.,0,0,0.005633378401398659

"Boston (CNN)After weeks of dramatic and emotionally wrenching testimony in the Boston Marathon bombing trial, jurors deliberated for more than seven hours Tuesday. But they haven't reached a verdict yet. The jurors sent out two questions, which are scheduled to be addressed when they return to court Wednesday morning. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the 21-year-old accused Boston Marathon bomber, faces life in prison or the death penalty. On Monday, the jury saw a video of the moment a bomb exploded and disemboweled an 8-year-old boy and ripped the leg off his sister. The blast killed a 23-year-old graduate student from China. The jurors heard more horror from April 15, 2013. At one point, prosecutors played a video that showed the scene after a bomb exploded -- blood and injured victims everywhere and the sounds of a child howling. His mother lost her leg. ""The defendant brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty said. ""The defendant thought that his values were more important than the people around him. He wanted to awake the mujahedeen, the holy warriors, so he chose Patriots' Day, Marathon Monday,"" a time for families to gather and watch the marathon. Tsarnaev's defense attorney Judy Clarke tried to persuade jurors that her client's older brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died in a shootout with police days after the terror attack, was the instigator of the marathon plot. The younger man, Clarke said, was only following his older brother. ""If not for Tamerlan, it would not have happened,"" Clarke argued. Bomb survivors and victims' family members wiped away tears and comforted one another in court. Tsarnaev fidgeted at the defense table as he has done throughout the trial. Bill Richard, father of bomb victim Martin Richard, 8, craned his neck to watch Tsarnaev as the prosecutor spoke. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev ""chose a day when the eyes of the world would be on Boston,"" Chakravarty said. ""He chose a day when there would be civilians on the sidewalks, and he targeted those civilians: men, women and children."" The lawyer waited a beat. ""He wanted to terrorize this country. He wanted to punish America for what it was doing to his people."" The prosecutor showed a picture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, in the marathon crowd. The day of the bombings, Chakravarty said, ""they felt they were soldiers. They were the mujahedeen and they were bringing their battle to Boston."" Tsarnaev is accused of 30 counts, including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism. Seventeen of those counts carry a sentence of death or life imprisonment. If Tsarnaev is found guilty of at least one of the 17 capital counts, the trial will proceed to a second phase, the so-called penalty phase. That part of the trial will include evidence of aggravating and mitigating factors, and the jury will be asked to weigh elements that make this crime especially heinous against details from Tsarnaev's background and mental health history that would weigh in his favor. Since testimony began March 4, federal prosecutors have called 92 witnesses, and the defense just four. It seemed a mismatch from the start. ""He was there,"" Clarke conceded as the trial opened, but the defense strategy always had been to focus on persuading the jury to spare Tsarnaev's life. Jurors were shown a photo of Tsarnaev standing by a tree behind the family of Martin Richard. ""These children weren't innocent to him,"" the prosecutor said. ""They were American. He knew what that bag was designed to do."" Chakravarty quoted Martin's father who earlier testified, ""I guess we were just unlucky that day."" But luck had nothing to do with the Boston bombings, the prosecutor said. ""This was a cold, intentional, terrorist act,"" he said. The brothers' acts that day were intended, he said, ""to make a point. To tell America, 'We won't be terrorized by you anymore. We will terrorize you.' "" The defense has maintained that Tsarnaev, who was 19 and flunking out of college at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, fell under the sway of his older, more radicalized brother. ""In the past few weeks, we have come face to face with tragedy, suffering and grief in dimensions none of us could imagine,"" Clarke said. ""We've heard words, we've heard screams and we've heard cries. For this suffering and pain, there is no excuse."" She acknowledged her client participated in a ""senseless act."" Tamerlan Tsarnaev, a Golden Gloves boxer, had hoped to wage jihad, and his slacker younger brother was just along for the ride, the defense has maintained. During the 15-minute rebuttal period, prosecutor William Weinreb told jurors not to be distracted by the defense's ""attempt to point the finger at somebody else."" ""There should be no doubt in your mind that the defendant and his brother are equally guilty,"" he said. They were ""partners in crime."" Weinreb pointed out that after the bombing, Tsarnaev went to the grocery store. ""Tamerlan Tsarnaev didn't turn his brother into a murderer. To shred the bodies of women and children with a homemade type of bomb, you have to be different from other people,"" the prosecutor said. ""If you are capable of such hate, such callousness that you can murder and maim 20 people and then drive to Whole Foods and buy some milk, can you really blame it on your brother?"" The radicalization of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. From the start, prosecutors presented a compelling case in which the horrors of April 15 to 19, 2013, were vividly brought to life once again. They began with the stories of bombing survivors and first responders, who described acts of courage and compassion amid madness and chaos. The final moments of the three Boston Marathon spectators who died were recounted by the people who were by their sides. According to testimony, Tamerlan Tsarnaev set off a bomb made from a 6-quart pressure cooker, explosive powder from fireworks, duct tape, nails and BBs on Boylston Street near the finish line. That bomb, which exploded near Marathon Sports, claimed the life of Krystle Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant manager. Twelve seconds later, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev allegedly detonated a second, similar bomb outside the Forum restaurant, slightly more than a block away. That blast killed the boy, Martin Richard, and Lingzi Lu, 23, a graduate student from China. Chakravarty's voice grew soft Monday as he recalled the victims:. Martin's 69-pound body ""was shattered, broken, eviscerated, burned. There wasn't a part of this boy's body that wasn't destroyed."" Lu ""received blast injuries all over her body. Her leg was torn open, and she bled out."" Campbell died in less than a minute from ""massive blast injuries to her lower extremities. Parts of her body were shredded."" Sean Collier, the MIT campus police officer killed three days after the bombings, ""never had a chance."" He was shot between the eyes. ""They assassinated him."" The brothers allegedly killed the 26-year-old officer for his service weapon but couldn't pry it loose from a safety holster. Case ends with grisly photos and testimony. Dun Meng told the jury about his frightening 90 minutes with two carjackers, one who admitted being involved in the marathon bombing. He identified that person as Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Police fired 210 rounds at the brothers when they tracked a GPS device in Meng's stolen Mercedes and cornered them in Watertown, Massachusetts. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev struck Tamerlan, who was wounded, when he charged police in the car. Tamerlan died of his injuries. ""Tamerlan wanted suicide by cop,"" the prosecutor said Monday. ""He was ready for heaven. But the defendant had other plans."" Dzhokhar ditched the stolen car and sought shelter in a dry-docked boat parked in a trailer in a backyard in Watertown. As he hid, he used a pencil to scrawl what prosecutors called a ""manifesto"" in which he said he was jealous of his brother for dying as a martyr and reaching paradise. He also lashed out at the United States for policies he said killed Muslims, writing, ""I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished. We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all."" Federal prosecutors also presented evidence gleaned from searches of the brothers' computers, including militant literature written by top al Qaeda leaders. And they traced the purchase of the pressure cookers, ammunition and BBs, which appeared to have been made by Tamerlan. Boston trial: What defense?

The definition of fiscal year (abbreviated FY) is a company’s annual accounting period over a span of 12 consecutive months. In the US, a company’s fiscal year reflects a given accounting period for financial statements and federal tax payments, but it does not necessarily start on the first day of the calendar year. A company’s fiscal year always aligns with the end date of a given 12-month period. For example, a fiscal year from May 1 2020 to April 30 2021 would be FY 2021. Fiscal years also always end on the last day of the month, unless it is December (in which case it would simply be a calendar year).
Eligible businesses in different industries may align their tax years with the seasonality of their businesses. For instance, many retail businesses begin their fiscal year on February 1st (with a year-end date of January 31st the following year) to account for holiday shopping traffic. Certain types of businesses—like sole proprietorships, S corporations , or personal service corporations—must coordinate their fiscal year with the calendar year, unless they file to change their tax year with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) form 1128.
A fiscal year covers a company’s annual accounting period, while a tax year refers to the 12-month period covering a business or individual’s tax return. The tax year dictates the timeline that a person or business uses to submit their income tax to see how much they will owe to (or are owed by) the government.
A fiscal year refers to the specific annual bookkeeping period that a company follows, which is used to inform annual reports for a company’s financials. The IRS’ standard tax year covers the time between January 1st and December 31st of a given year, with tax returns due on the fifteenth of the fourth month following the tax year’s end. A company can align its tax filing with its fiscal year, depending on the person or business filing.
From multimillion-dollar businesses to non-profit organizations, fiscal years are commonplace for financial accounting. Here are three common examples of a fiscal year that does not align with the calendar year.
- 1. The US government : The US federal government’s fiscal year begins October 1 of the earlier year and ends September 30 of the following year.
- 2. Retailers : A common fiscal year for retailers is February 1 to January 31. Many retailers see a rise in sales during the holidays, particularly at the end of the year.
- 3. School districts : For many school systems, a fiscal year starts July 1 and ends June 30, around when school is usually let out for summer.
A company’s fiscal year is important for business because it determines the timeline over which a company analyzes its financial documents. This process helps with budgeting, calculating expenses, cash flow, or tax filing. A business’ annual reports over a fiscal year can help its officials analyze a business’ financial strengths and weaknesses. A company’s fiscal year is also important because it may coincide with the correct time to file a business’s tax returns with the IRS.
Many companies use different fiscal years for their financial reporting. Here are a few guidelines on how to determine your company’s fiscal year.
- 1. Look at your company’s busiest seasons . Some seasonal businesses, like tourism, are more popular during certain times of the year. If you do more business during a specific period of time (like retailers during holiday seasons) you may choose your fiscal year-end to occur right after the highest activity to have a full idea of your business’s financial performance.
- 2. Speak to your accountant . Changing your company’s fiscal year may be complicated, so you want to make sure that you speak to your accountant before you attempt to do so. They will be able to help you determine if you are eligible because there are some barriers to entry. For instance, if your company doesn’t keep financial records, you are required to use the standard calendar year as your fiscal year.
- 3. File IRS form 1128 . If your business is eligible to change its fiscal year to anything other than the calendar year, you must file IRS form 1128 to declare your new fiscal year. Your request to change your fiscal year is subject to IRS approval.

"Social Security Benefits to Increase by 3.2% in 2024
Los Angeles, California (LAI) - Over 66 million retirees receiving Social Security checks will see a 3.2% increase in their monthly government payments in 2024, thanks to the Social Security Administration's cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). The announcement was made by the Social Security Administration (SSA) on October 12, 2023.
On average, Social Security retirement monthly benefits will grow by more than $50 starting in January 2024. The COLA adjustment aims to help retirees keep up with increasing living expenses, providing a measure of inflation protection.
In addition to the COLA increase, other adjustments take effect every January based on the increase in average wages. As a result, the maximum amount of earnings subject to the Social Security tax (taxable maximum) will increase to $168,600 in 2024, up from $160,200 in 2023.
The annual COLA is tied to the increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, as determined by the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics. The CPI report indicates the impact of the Federal Reserve's efforts to combat inflation through interest rate hikes.
Beneficiaries will receive notices of the increase in early December, and those with a personal My Social Security account can view their COLA notice online. They can also set up text or email alerts for new messages regarding COLA until November 14.
For more information about Medicare changes for 2024, beneficiaries can visit www.medicare.gov.
The Senior Citizens League (TSCL) previously estimated a 3.2% COLA for 2024, based on consumer price data through August. While this is lower than the 8.7% COLA received in 2023, it is higher than the 20-year average of 2.6%.
A 3.2% COLA in 2024 would increase the average monthly retiree benefit of $1,790 by $57.30, according to the TSCL.
Key Points:
Social Security beneficiaries will see a 3.2% increase in their monthly government payments in 2024, with an average growth of over $50 starting in January.
The COLA adjustment aims to help retirees keep up with rising living expenses.
The maximum amount of earnings subject to the Social Security tax will increase to $168,600 in 2024.
Beneficiaries will receive notices of the COLA increase in early December.
The 2024 COLA is based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers.

"The California Public Utilities Commission on Thursday said it is ordering Pacific Gas & Electric Co. to pay a record $1.6 billion penalty for unsafe operation of its gas transmission system, including the pipeline rupture that killed eight people in San Bruno in September 2010. Most of the penalty amounts to forced spending on improving pipeline safety. Of the $1.6 billion, $850 million will go to ""gas transmission pipeline safety infrastructure improvements,"" the commission said. Another $50 million will go toward ""other remedies to enhance pipeline safety,"" according to the commission. ""PG&E failed to uphold the public's trust,"" commission President Michael Picker said. ""The CPUC failed to keep vigilant. Lives were lost. Numerous people were injured. Homes were destroyed. We must do everything we can to ensure that nothing like this happens again."" The company's chief executive officer said in a written statement that PG&E is working to become the safest energy company in the United States. ""Since the 2010 explosion of our natural gas transmission pipeline in San Bruno, we have worked hard to do the right thing for the victims, their families and the community of San Bruno,"" Tony Earley said. ""We are deeply sorry for this tragic event, and we have dedicated ourselves to re-earning the trust of our customers and the communities we serve. The lessons of this tragic event will not be forgotten."" On September 9, 2010, a section of PG&E pipeline exploded in San Bruno, killing eight people and injuring more than 50 others. The blast destroyed 37 homes. PG&E said it has paid more than $500 million in claims to the victims and victims' families in San Bruno, which is just south of San Francisco. The company also said it has already replaced more than 800 miles of pipe, installed new gas leak technology and implemented nine of 12 recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board. According to its website, PG&E has 5.4 million electric customers and 4.3 million natural gas customers. The Los Angeles Times reported the previous record penalty was a $146 million penalty against Southern California Edison Company in 2008 for falsifying customer and worker safety data.

"Boston (CNN)After weeks of dramatic and emotionally wrenching testimony in the Boston Marathon bombing trial, jurors deliberated for more than seven hours Tuesday. But they haven't reached a verdict yet. The jurors sent out two questions, which are scheduled to be addressed when they return to court Wednesday morning. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the 21-year-old accused Boston Marathon bomber, faces life in prison or the death penalty. On Monday, the jury saw a video of the moment a bomb exploded and disemboweled an 8-year-old boy and ripped the leg off his sister. The blast killed a 23-year-old graduate student from China. The jurors heard more horror from April 15, 2013. At one point, prosecutors played a video that showed the scene after a bomb exploded -- blood and injured victims everywhere and the sounds of a child howling. His mother lost her leg. ""The defendant brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty said. ""The defendant thought that his values were more important than the people around him. He wanted to awake the mujahedeen, the holy warriors, so he chose Patriots' Day, Marathon Monday,"" a time for families to gather and watch the marathon. Tsarnaev's defense attorney Judy Clarke tried to persuade jurors that her client's older brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died in a shootout with police days after the terror attack, was the instigator of the marathon plot. The younger man, Clarke said, was only following his older brother. ""If not for Tamerlan, it would not have happened,"" Clarke argued. Bomb survivors and victims' family members wiped away tears and comforted one another in court. Tsarnaev fidgeted at the defense table as he has done throughout the trial. Bill Richard, father of bomb victim Martin Richard, 8, craned his neck to watch Tsarnaev as the prosecutor spoke. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev ""chose a day when the eyes of the world would be on Boston,"" Chakravarty said. ""He chose a day when there would be civilians on the sidewalks, and he targeted those civilians: men, women and children."" The lawyer waited a beat. ""He wanted to terrorize this country. He wanted to punish America for what it was doing to his people."" The prosecutor showed a picture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, in the marathon crowd. The day of the bombings, Chakravarty said, ""they felt they were soldiers. They were the mujahedeen and they were bringing their battle to Boston."" Tsarnaev is accused of 30 counts, including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism. Seventeen of those counts carry a sentence of death or life imprisonment. If Tsarnaev is found guilty of at least one of the 17 capital counts, the trial will proceed to a second phase, the so-called penalty phase. That part of the trial will include evidence of aggravating and mitigating factors, and the jury will be asked to weigh elements that make this crime especially heinous against details from Tsarnaev's background and mental health history that would weigh in his favor. Since testimony began March 4, federal prosecutors have called 92 witnesses, and the defense just four. It seemed a mismatch from the start. ""He was there,"" Clarke conceded as the trial opened, but the defense strategy always had been to focus on persuading the jury to spare Tsarnaev's life. Jurors were shown a photo of Tsarnaev standing by a tree behind the family of Martin Richard. ""These children weren't innocent to him,"" the prosecutor said. ""They were American. He knew what that bag was designed to do."" Chakravarty quoted Martin's father who earlier testified, ""I guess we were just unlucky that day."" But luck had nothing to do with the Boston bombings, the prosecutor said. ""This was a cold, intentional, terrorist act,"" he said. The brothers' acts that day were intended, he said, ""to make a point. To tell America, 'We won't be terrorized by you anymore. We will terrorize you.' "" The defense has maintained that Tsarnaev, who was 19 and flunking out of college at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, fell under the sway of his older, more radicalized brother. ""In the past few weeks, we have come face to face with tragedy, suffering and grief in dimensions none of us could imagine,"" Clarke said. ""We've heard words, we've heard screams and we've heard cries. For this suffering and pain, there is no excuse."" She acknowledged her client participated in a ""senseless act."" Tamerlan Tsarnaev, a Golden Gloves boxer, had hoped to wage jihad, and his slacker younger brother was just along for the ride, the defense has maintained. During the 15-minute rebuttal period, prosecutor William Weinreb told jurors not to be distracted by the defense's ""attempt to point the finger at somebody else."" ""There should be no doubt in your mind that the defendant and his brother are equally guilty,"" he said. They were ""partners in crime."" Weinreb pointed out that after the bombing, Tsarnaev went to the grocery store. ""Tamerlan Tsarnaev didn't turn his brother into a murderer. To shred the bodies of women and children with a homemade type of bomb, you have to be different from other people,"" the prosecutor said. ""If you are capable of such hate, such callousness that you can murder and maim 20 people and then drive to Whole Foods and buy some milk, can you really blame it on your brother?"" The radicalization of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. From the start, prosecutors presented a compelling case in which the horrors of April 15 to 19, 2013, were vividly brought to life once again. They began with the stories of bombing survivors and first responders, who described acts of courage and compassion amid madness and chaos. The final moments of the three Boston Marathon spectators who died were recounted by the people who were by their sides. According to testimony, Tamerlan Tsarnaev set off a bomb made from a 6-quart pressure cooker, explosive powder from fireworks, duct tape, nails and BBs on Boylston Street near the finish line. That bomb, which exploded near Marathon Sports, claimed the life of Krystle Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant manager. Twelve seconds later, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev allegedly detonated a second, similar bomb outside the Forum restaurant, slightly more than a block away. That blast killed the boy, Martin Richard, and Lingzi Lu, 23, a graduate student from China. Chakravarty's voice grew soft Monday as he recalled the victims:. Martin's 69-pound body ""was shattered, broken, eviscerated, burned. There wasn't a part of this boy's body that wasn't destroyed."" Lu ""received blast injuries all over her body. Her leg was torn open, and she bled out."" Campbell died in less than a minute from ""massive blast injuries to her lower extremities. Parts of her body were shredded."" Sean Collier, the MIT campus police officer killed three days after the bombings, ""never had a chance."" He was shot between the eyes. ""They assassinated him."" The brothers allegedly killed the 26-year-old officer for his service weapon but couldn't pry it loose from a safety holster. Case ends with grisly photos and testimony. Dun Meng told the jury about his frightening 90 minutes with two carjackers, one who admitted being involved in the marathon bombing. He identified that person as Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Police fired 210 rounds at the brothers when they tracked a GPS device in Meng's stolen Mercedes and cornered them in Watertown, Massachusetts. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev struck Tamerlan, who was wounded, when he charged police in the car. Tamerlan died of his injuries. ""Tamerlan wanted suicide by cop,"" the prosecutor said Monday. ""He was ready for heaven. But the defendant had other plans."" Dzhokhar ditched the stolen car and sought shelter in a dry-docked boat parked in a trailer in a backyard in Watertown. As he hid, he used a pencil to scrawl what prosecutors called a ""manifesto"" in which he said he was jealous of his brother for dying as a martyr and reaching paradise. He also lashed out at the United States for policies he said killed Muslims, writing, ""I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished. We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all."" Federal prosecutors also presented evidence gleaned from searches of the brothers' computers, including militant literature written by top al Qaeda leaders. And they traced the purchase of the pressure cookers, ammunition and BBs, which appeared to have been made by Tamerlan. Boston trial: What defense?

"The American Pharmacists Association is discouraging its members from participating in executions. On Monday, the group voted at its annual meeting to adopt a ban as an official policy, stating that ""such activities are fundamentally contrary to the role of pharmacists as healthcare providers."" This bolsters the association's previous positions to oppose the use of the term ""drug"" for chemicals used in lethal injection and to oppose laws that require or prohibit pharmacists from participation in lethal injection cases. The group acted this week because of increased public attention on lethal injection, said Michelle Spinnler, spokeswoman for the American Pharmacists Association. That spotlight includes a January Supreme Court decision to stay the execution for three death row inmates in Oklahoma. This was prompted by Clayton Lockett's execution by lethal injection nearly one year ago in which he writhed on a gurney for 43 minutes before he died from a heart attack. In Georgia last month, the execution of female death row inmate Kelly Renee Gissendaner was postponed as a precaution when the execution team checked the medications and discovered they looked cloudy. Thirty-two sates allow capital punishment, and lethal injection is still the most common method. Last month, Utah Gov. Gary R. Herbert signed a law reinstating firing squads as a method of execution in cases in which lethal injection medications are not available. Of the eight inmates currently on death row in Utah, three opted for the new choice of death by firing squad. Pentobarbital is the preferred drug used for lethal injection. In Texas, the department of criminal justice told CNN in March they are running out of their supply. In July 2011, Lundbeck Inc., the manufacturer of pentobarbital, decided to no longer provide the drug to prisons for use in capital punishment. The companies that manufacture the products traditionally used in executions almost unilaterally decided to stop selling to institutions that used the products for that purpose, so states then turned to compounded preparations, Spinnler said. ""Pharmacists should not be involved in preparation of these products or involved in executions in any other way."" she says. The new declaration by the American Pharmacists Association aligns with positions held by other professional medical organizations such as the American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association and the American Board of Anesthesiology.

"Speaker 1: Five F recommendation to authorize the Interim City Manager to execute an agreement with CSG consulting services for professional plant services for 12 months. Permanent amount not to exceed 300,000.
Speaker 0: And I pulled this item. I don't know if staff wants to present anything about it. I pulled it because it's for up to 300,000 for structural engineer or an engineering firm. And it's my understanding that we, the city had had had an engineer through that, resigned in June. And so now we're being asked to approve a contract with a consulting firm out of San Mateo to make up for that. That would be up to 12 months and $300,000.
Speaker 2: So. Good evening. My name is Debbie Potter and I'm the city's community development director. And it is accurate that we had a plan check engineer that was working with the city. He actually resigned a year ago in June. So we have been using outside planned check services for several years now. We are using these planned check services. We are incredibly busy at the permit center and the flexibility that we have by using planned check services outside, planned check services we can use from one to 10 to 15 plan checkers all at the same time to keep moving our projects through the system. And while we do use planned check services, it should be noted that about 75% of all plan checking happens over the counter right here at City Hall. But 25% of our projects are complicated enough that they have to go out to a structural engineer. We're using CSG. It's the same plan check services that we that the fire department uses for its planned tech services. So that synergy has been very nice for us to have plan checkers that are very familiar with both the city's fire code and then all the building codes. We would like to continue on with the services that we are receiving from CSG. There is no impact on the general fund CSG. The contract is set up so that they charge 65% of the cost of the building permit, so that we are always providing services to applicants within the budget that we charge for building permits. It's no impact on the general fund and we will be continuing to look throughout this fiscal year at how we want to staff up that function within the department. And we're looking at perhaps keeping outside contract services and then possibly under filling the position with a plans examiner so we can do more over the counter. So we feel like we have an efficient model in place and it's really based on that analysis and the track record for the last year and a half that we're recommending approval of this contract for the current fiscal year.
Speaker 0: Do we have any engineers as part of our staff? Can you describe the types of engineers that we have as part of our staff?
Speaker 2: So the building official is has a degree in architecture, which is structural engineers and architects are the ones who can do the plan, check services. And then we have our supervising building inspector is a plan examiner, a certified plans examiner. So those are the two certified staff that we have.
Speaker 0: But do we have any engineers as part of our staff? That's actually my concern.
Speaker 2: We currently do not have a structural engineer, Madame Mayor. We have engineers in our public works department.
Speaker 0: Advanced planning. No, no, no. So that's that's where I'm that's where my question goes. My preference would be that we have at least one engineer on our staff. And it appears that that's counter to what the plan currently is with staff, that you plan to continue to have a consulting firm as opposed to an engineer that's actually an employee of the city, which I we used to have that and I and I think I've seen that that issue has been raised in regards to having an engineer as part of our planning department. So that was my concern. And I pulled out. And I actually think that the community is interested in this issue because there have been multiple letters to the editor regarding engineers as part of our planning department, separate from public works. And I appreciate that.
Speaker 2: Right. Most of those letters, though, are all about the public works engineers. Those letters that we've received have not been about the planning department. But I understand what you're saying, and we can take a look at it, because our building official, who has a degree in architecture, is able to do the same types of plan checking as a structural engineer it we just feel like it's more efficient to be able to access multiple structural engineers during our very busy period. And that's really what what we need and what we need. Internal to our staff are the certified plans examiners. And that's we also we do have several certified plans examiners on staff.
Speaker 0: And I appreciate that. Thank you for the comments.
Speaker 8: No, I just said I'm willing to move approval because I think Mr. Potter gave an excellent explanation if we want to keep these projects moving. Time is money. This is not impacting our general fund, and I think we're serving our community well. So with that, I will move approval of item five after recommendation to authorize the Interim City Manager to execute an agreement with CSG consulting services for professional plant services for a 12 month term in an amount not to exceed $300,000.

"[1] * Stocks, or shares of a company, represent ownership equity in the firm, which give shareholders voting rights as well as a residual claim on corporate earnings in the form of capital gains and dividends.
* Stock markets are where individual and institutional investors come together to buy and sell shares in a public venue. Nowadays these exchanges exist as electronic marketplaces.
* Share prices are set by supply and demand in the market as buyers and sellers place orders. Order flow and bid-ask spreads are often maintained by specialists or market makers to ensure an orderly and fair market.

[2] A stock market is a place where licensed people, or brokers, go to buy and sell stock in a company.
How does that stock get there and why do people want to own it?
First, a company needs to be listed on a market like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), based on Wall Street, for people to be able to trade its shares.
A company will choose to list its shares to the public usually in order to raise cash to invest in the business activities and it's called an IPO, or initial public offering.
When this happens, the company sells off slices of the business so anyone is able to buy a piece and the company receives the money.

[3] Companies sell stock, or partial ownership in the company, to investors in order to raise money. And as those companies increase or decrease in value, the value of your investment will rise and fall.

[4] The stock market works through a network of exchanges — you may have heard of the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq. Companies list shares of their stock on an exchange through a process called an . Investors purchase those shares, which allows the company to raise money to grow its business. Investors can then buy and sell these stocks among themselves, and the exchange tracks the supply and demand of each listed stock.
That supply and demand help determine the price for each security, or the levels at which stock market participants — investors and traders — are willing to buy or sell.
Buyers offer a “bid,” or the highest amount they’re willing to pay, which is usually lower than the amount sellers “ask” for in exchange. This difference is called the bid-ask spread. For a trade to occur, a buyer needs to increase his price or a seller needs to decrease hers.
This all may sound complicated, but computer algorithms generally do most of price-setting calculations. When buying stock, you’ll see the bid, ask, and bid-ask spread on your broker's website, but in many cases, the difference will be pennies, and won’t be of much concern for","The company then uses the money to invest in activities that will benefit the company, such as research and development, hiring of new employees, and expanding their product or service offerings.",1,0,0.09563706815242767

"I'm haunted by the video of Officer Michael Slager firing eight shots at Walter Scott as he fled his encounter with North Charleston police -- his back turned to the officer. What I find more disturbing is how the officer cuffs the fallen Scott and allows him to die face-down in the dirt while Slager appears to plant an item next to his body. I understand why people are skeptical of self-defense claims -- especially from law enforcement. If not for the video taken by a bystander, I can't help but think that this story would be shuttered behind the wall of an active investigation. As a defense attorney, I am more sensitive than anyone to the assumption of innocence for those accused of a crime, but this single piece of evidence -- a video of a man shot in the back while in full retreat -- defies any reasonable explanation. Thank God there was a camera. It will help ensure that justice will be served in this case. However, there is another camera that -- had it been deployed -- might have prevented the entire tragedy: a police body camera. Throughout the entire encounter with Scott, it's clear Slager had no idea someone was filming him. Had he known there would be video of his every move, would he have drawn his weapon on a fleeing man?  Would he have fired?  Eight times?  Would he have misrepresented the encounter on his police report? Of course not. If Slager had been wearing a body camera, Scott would probably still be alive, and Slager wouldn't be facing the possibility of life in prison -- or a possible death sentence. Body cameras are expensive to deploy, sure. And storing the massive amounts of data that body cameras create costs even more. That cost, however -- if we're talking the monetary kind -- may be eclipsed by the punitive damages delivered to Scott's family in an inevitable civil suit against the North Charleston Police Department. Most importantly, we have to ask ourselves this: What's the value of a human life? Certainly it's worth the price of some mass data storage. And there's something else at stake. The public is losing confidence in law enforcement, and the strained relationship between minorities and police is reaching a breaking point. Every police shooting that captures headlines justifies an ever increasing fear of cops in the street. As fear ratchets up, so does the tension between cops and the people in the communities they serve. As tension rises, the risk of more shootings increases. It is a cycle of destruction that could lead to chaos. Police body cameras can help break this cycle. Studies have shown that both cops and people in the community act better when they know they are on camera. Complaints against cops decrease, and, most importantly, use-of-force incidents drop. I will admit that body cameras are only an interim solution. They only help compensate for the real underlying problem, which is this: There is a bias against black men that has infiltrated the criminal justice system, and we are seeing it in the disproportionate shooting of black men. When we look at this footage -- and when we see the dashboard camera from the other South Carolina officer who last year shot a man who was reaching for his driver's license -- it's clear that many cops are more likely to interpret actions, even routine actions, from black men as potentially aggressive. These may not be overtly racist cops. They may not intentionally treat black men differently, but we can't pretend that black men aren't being disproportionately targeted. All across the country, we see it happening, and with the proliferation of video, we're seeing it happen with alarming frequency. Somehow, we're going to have to beat this bias out of our system. Set tougher employment screening standards when hiring cops. Institute more training to help officers recognize the bias and adjust for it. As a society, we have to focus on the broad social changes needed to address disparities in income, education and opportunities -- disparities that keep us a racially divided nation. But social change, sadly, may take generations of hard work. In the meantime, if we can't immediately root out racial bias, we can at least put a bright spotlight on it, and we can start by focusing on the one interaction where racial bias results in the loss of life -- we can start by placing body-mounted cameras on cops.

"Inter Milan are prepared to offer Yaya Toure a five-year contract to lure him away from Manchester City this summer. Despite the fact Toure turns 32 next month, Roberto Mancini is so desperate to sign the powerful midfielder that he's ready to give the Ivory Coast midfielder a deal that will see him play beyond his 37th birthday. Mancini, who signed Toure for Manchester City in 2010, is working hard behind the scenes to bring Toure to Serie A next season. Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure remains a top target for Serie A giants Inter Milan . Toure, pictured with Vincent Kompany, will be offered a new deal by Manchester City in the summer . Former Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini is keen on bringing Toure to the San Siro. The Italian believes Toure has the capacity to dominate games in Serie A well into his mid-30s, like Juventus midfielder Andrea Pirlo has. The midfielder's representatives are fully aware of Inter's interest and are keeping their options open going into the summer. City want to keep Toure, who currently earns £220,000-per-week, and will offer him a new contract at the end of the season, which will also include the opportunity to take up an ambassadorial role at the club when his playing days are over. But Inter will test City's resolve to keep Toure this summer and hope the prospect of a long-term deal will be enough to persuade the former Barcelona to leave England. The 31-year-old scored a consolation goal in Manchester City's surprise 2-1 defeat by Crystal Palace . Toure walks off the Selhurst Park pitch following his side's Premier League defeat at Selhurst Park.  .","Inter Milan are prepared to offer Yaya Toure a five - year contract.

"There is a special kind of hell reserved for the women who fall into the clutches of today's Jihadi fighters. We are all familiar with the brutality of ISIS, the self-anointed Islamic State, or Boko Haram, the Nigerian terrorists who have pledged allegiance to ISIS. This new wave of violent Islamist groups proudly brandishes medieval methods of cruelty through modern technology as a tool of recruitment and intimidation. But there is something very different about the way they treat women. The jihadi chiefs have a strategy beyond the battlefield. Their treatment of their female victims plays an important part in their ambitious radical strategy. Killing the enemy, the men, is a tactic for winning battles and conquering territory. What they do to women has an altogether different purpose: It is part of the larger plan of building a ""caliphate,"" a Sharia-ruled state complete with controls and norms harking back to the seventh century or, rather, to the group's interpretation of life in the early days of Islam. Yazidi girls who slipped ISIS after its siege of Mount Sinjar describe how they were sent to slave warehouses along with hundreds of other women. There, they were lined up in groups of 50 and displayed for ISIS fighters to choose among them, some for marriage, others for sexual slavery. The stories told to journalists or to human rights workers are confirmed by doctors who have examined the girls and say they have found evidence of repeated sexual assault. An investigation by Human Rights Watch found  ""a system of organized rape and sexual assault, sexual slavery, and forced marriage by ISIS forces,"" actions that the group says ""are war crimes and may be crimes against humanity."" In Nigeria, Boko Haram also has a very specific approach to women. The 276 students kidnapped one year ago make up a small portion of the 2,000 women and girls kidnapped by the group since 2014, according to  Amnesty International. There, too, women captives move from house to house and village to village, forced to convert when they are not Muslim, and prepare for marriage to jihadis. It's a stark change from the previous generation of jihadis, when Osama bin Laden headed al Qaeda. Women were not a big part of al Qaeda's immediate plans because al Qaeda, unlike ISIS, viewed the establishment of a caliphate as a distant goal, one for future generations. In contrast, ISIS is actively engaged in building those social structures. And if you want to build a new society, you need more than soldiers. You also need women. Women are indispensable for establishing a functioning community, even one whose laws are brutally repressive. Even if women are viewed as the property of men, they are still needed, not just for cooking, cleaning and sex, but to keep the home and raise children; hence the methodical capture, assault and subjugation. It is no accident that Boko Haram has targeted students, as it did in Chibok, or that Somalia's Al-Shabaab Islamists killed scores of women in the massacre at Kenya's Garissa University in Kenya. As in previous conflicts, women are spoils of war and rape is a weapon of war. It is a way to humiliate the enemy, a ""reward"" for soldiers and a tactic of ethnic cleansing. During the Bosnian war of the 1990s, experts said Serbian soldiers engaged in systematic rape, thinking the babies of raped Bosnian Muslim women would be Serbian. In Darfur, government-backed militias were accused of using mass rape to humiliate the non-Arab groups. But this is different. The women are not simply abused and discarded. ISIS and Boko Haram are enslaving them and incorporating them into the daily life of territories they rule, subjecting them to asphyxiating restrictions and abuses that have caused many of them to attempt suicide, according to some of those who escaped -- a phenomenon reminiscent of Afghanistan during the rule of the Taliban, another radical Islamic group that managed to take control and impose unspeakable rules for women. ISIS is going to great lengths to prove how its treatment of women, including the selling of Yazidi prisoners as slaves, is in keeping with Islamic law. Its online magazine cites Islamic writings proclaiming: ""We will conquer your Rome, break your crosses, and enslave your women, by the permission of Allah."" The worst fate is reserved for non-Muslims, such as Yazidis, but Muslim women in areas seized by Islamists have seen disaster. From Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, a modern town until ISIS conquered it last year, women say, ""They have withheld all freedoms from us"" and describe oppressive, fear-filled lives. The brutality of the new jihadis is more than mere sadism. If it is madness, it is madness with a method. And when it comes to women, the method is one that aims to control them as a way to establish the society they envision, one where some women say life is simply not worth living.

Additionally, GnRH treatment improved the expression of neurofilaments at the lesion site, suggesting axonal growth (Calderón-Vallejo and Quintanar, 2012).

"New York (CNN)A New York Police Department detective apologized Friday for an angry exchange with an Uber driver that was caught on video and landed him on modified assignment. ""I apologize. I sincerely apologize,"" Patrick Cherry told WNBC's Jonathan Dienst. Cherry, an NYPD detective assigned to the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force with top-secret security clearance, faces suspension, reassignment or loss of his clearance after the video of the altercation went viral. ""I was just angry, at that moment, for that exchange."" Cherry said. ""If the conversation initially went differently, we probably would have shook hands at the end of that encounter."" The altercation began Monday when the Uber driver gestured to a detective in an unmarked car to use his blinker after he was allegedly attempting to park without using it, according to Sanjay Seth, a passenger in the car who uploaded the video to YouTube. The video picks up seconds after the detective began yelling at the driver and mocking his accent, and also shows the unmarked car with lights flashing pulled over behind the Uber car. In the video, the detective tells the driver he has committed ""three traffic and law violations""  and then becomes irate and uses expletives toward the comparably calm driver. A visibly upset Police Commissioner William Bratton on Wednesday said the detective was placed on modified assignment pending an investigation. ""No good cop can watch that without a wince,"" he told reporters. ""As all good cops know ... the officer made their jobs a little bit harder. That kind of anger like that is unacceptable in any encounter; discourtesy like that and language like that is unacceptable. That officer's behavior reflected poorly on everyone who wears our uniform."" Cherry also apologized to the police commissioner, saying ""he's doing a lot of good work to strengthen community relations in the city and I set that back. I would work, personally work to fix that."" ""You can't judge three minutes of a tape involving me and me alone as indication that that's the kind of practice of the New York City Police Department,"" he added. Bratton, who said the detective was on duty at the time, issued an apology to the driver and passengers. Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters at an unrelated news conference that he had not seen the video. ""There's just no place for any public servant to use discriminatory or negative language,"" he said. ""Obviously, our police play a particularly sensitive role and need to show respect for all people."" In a statement, Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives' Endowment Association, called the officer ""a person of good character and an excellent detective"" who ""should not be judged by one isolated incident."" ""I am not trying to minimize the significance of what occurred,"" Palladino said. ""I am simply pointing out that cops are just like everyone else. They have families, friends and other things going on in their lives, too, that may affect their behavior at times. There is no disputing that we are held to a higher standard, that is why this incident is so newsworthy."" In the video, after the detective steps back to his car, the Uber driver, who moved to America less than two years ago, turns to the passenger and thanks him for recording the video. ""That's crazy. That's really inappropriate,"" the passenger tells the driver. ""Listen, it's not your fault. He shouldn't be slamming your car door, throwing things around. He doesn't have a right to open your door."" When the detective comes back, he is irate and doesn't allow the driver to speak. ""I don't care what you have to say, people are allowed to park their cars on the side of the street without your interference,"" the detective tells the driver. ""I don't know where you're coming from, where you think it's appropriate in doing that. That's the way it works."" ""I've got news for you,"" the detective says, ""the only reason you're not in handcuffs and going to jail and getting summons in the precinct is because I have things to do. That's the only reason that's not happening. Because this isn't important enough for me. You're not important enough. Don't ever do that again."" The NYPD said the Internal Affairs Bureau is investigating the incident. ""The behavior in the video is wrong and unacceptable and we appreciate the NYPD investigating the incident. We are in touch with our driver-partner who was subjected to this terrible experience and will continue to provide any support he needs,"" Uber said Tuesday. Seth met Wednesday with an investigator from the Civilian Complaint Review Board, according to board spokeswoman Linda Sachs. The investigator is attempting to interview the driver as well as the police officer. The findings will be presented to the board, which will make an official determination on whether misconduct was committed, Sachs said. The board will either refer the decision to the NYPD with a disciplinary recommendation, or decide to bring up the officer on administrative charges, with the decision presented to the police commissioner. CNN's Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.

"As goes Walmart, so goes the nation? Everyone from Apple CEO Tim Cook to the head of the NCAA slammed religious freedom laws being considered in several states this week, warning that they would open the door to discrimination against gay and lesbian customers. But it was the opposition from Walmart, the ubiquitous retailer that dots the American landscape, that perhaps resonated most deeply, providing the latest evidence of growing support for gay rights in the heartland. Walmart's staunch criticism of a religious freedom law in its home state of Arkansas came after the company said in February it would boost pay for about 500,000 workers well above the federal minimum wage. Taken together, the company is emerging as a bellwether for shifting public opinion on hot-button political issues that divide conservatives and liberals. And some prominent Republicans are urging the party to take notice. Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who famously called on the GOP to ""be the party of Sam's Club, not just the country club,"" told CNN that Walmart's actions ""foreshadow where the Republican Party will need to move."" ""The Republican Party will have to better stand for"" ideas on helping the middle class, said Pawlenty, the head of the Financial Services Roundtable, a Washington lobbying group for the finance industry. The party's leaders must be ""willing to put forward ideas that will help modest income workers, such as a reasonable increase in the minimum wage, and prohibit discrimination in things such as jobs, housing, public accommodation against gays and lesbians."" Walmart, which employs more than 50,000 people in Arkansas, emerged victorious on Wednesday. Hours after the company's CEO, Doug McMillon, called on Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson to veto the bill, the governor held a news conference and announced he would not sign the legislation unless its language was fixed. Walmart's opposition to the religious freedom law once again puts the company at odds with many in the Republican Party, which the company's political action committee has tended to support. In 2004, the Walmart PAC gave around $2 million to Republicans versus less than $500,000 to Democrats, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. That gap has grown less pronounced in recent years. In 2014, the PAC spent about $1.3 million to support Republicans and around $970,000 for Democrats. It has been a gradual transformation for Walmart. In 2011, the company bulked up its nondiscrimination policies by adding protections for gender identity. Two years later, the company announced that it would start offering health insurance benefits to same-sex partners of employees starting in 2014. Retail experts say Walmart's evolution on these issues over the years is partly a reflection of its diverse consumer base, as well as a recognition of the country's increasingly progressive views of gay equality (support for same-sex marriage is at a new high of 59%, according to a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll). ""It's easy for someone like a Chick-fil-A to take a really polarizing position,"" said Dwight Hill, a partner at the retail consulting firm McMillanDoolittle. ""But in the world of the largest retailer in the world, that's very different."" Hill added: Same-sex marriage, ""while divisive, it's becoming more common place here within the U.S., and the businesses by definition have to follow the trend of their customer."" The backlash over the religious freedom measures in Indiana and Arkansas this week is shining a bright light on the broader business community's overwhelming support for workplace policies that promote gay equality. After Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a Republican, signed his state's religious freedom bill into law, CEOs of companies big and small across the country threatened to pull out of the Hoosier state. The resistance came from business leaders of all political persuasions, including Bill Oesterle, CEO of the business-rating website Angie's List and a one-time campaign manager for former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels. Oesterle announced that his company would put plans on hold to expand its footprint in Indianapolis in light of the state's passage of the religious freedom act. NASCAR, scheduled to hold a race in Indianapolis this summer, also spoke out against the Indiana law. ""What we're seeing over the past week is a tremendous amount of support from the business community who are standing up and are sending that equality is good for business and discrimination is bad for business,"" said Jason Rahlan, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign. The debate has reached presidential politics. National Republicans are being forced to walk the fine line of protecting religious liberties and supporting nondiscrimination. Likely GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush initially backed Indiana's religious freedom law and Pence, but moderated his tone a few days later. The former Florida governor said Wednesday that Indiana could have taken a ""better"" and ""more consensus-oriented approach."" ""By the end of the week, Indiana will be in the right place,"" Bush said, a reference to Pence's promise this week to fix his state's law in light of the widespread backlash. Others in the GOP field are digging in. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the only officially declared Republican presidential candidate, said Wednesday that he had no interest in second-guessing Pence and lashed out at the business community for opposing the law. ""I think it is unfortunate that large companies today are listening to the extreme left wing agenda that is driven by an aggressive gay marriage agenda,"" Cruz said. Meanwhile, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who previously served on Walmart's board of directors, called on Hutchinson to veto the Arkansas bill, saying it would ""permit unfair discrimination"" against the LGBT community. Jay Chesshir, CEO of the Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce in Arkansas, welcomed Hutchinson's pledge on Wednesday to seek changes to his state's bill. He said businesses are not afraid to wade into a politically controversial debate to ensure inclusive workplace policies. ""When it comes to culture and quality of life, businesses are extremely interested in engaging in debate simply because it impacts its more precious resource -- and that's its people,"" Chesshir said. ""Therefore, when issues arise that have negative or positive impact on those things, then the business community will again speak and speak loudly.""

The new building complex was designed to accommodate up to 2,300 ECB personnel. The location is a few kilometres away from the city centre and borders an industrial area as well as the Osthafen (East Harbour), It was primarily chosen because of its large premises which allows the ECB to install security arrangements without high fences.","The European Central Bank is headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany.",1,1,0.9800671935081482
"California Drug Kingpin Sentenced to Life in Prison for Meth Conspiracies in Oklahoma and Missouri
In a significant victory against drug trafficking, Luis Alfredo Jacobo, a California drug kingpin, has been sentenced to four life terms in federal prison. U.S. District Judge John C. Coughenour handed down this severe punishment, including one life sentence for directing a continuing criminal enterprise and three additional life sentences for drug conspiracy. Jacobo was also sentenced to four years on 21 counts of unlawful use of a communication facility, with all sentences to be served concurrently.
Jacobo, based in Bakersfield, California, orchestrated and directed multiple methamphetamine conspiracies that spanned Oklahoma and Missouri for over five years. His operations involved coordinating with more than a dozen individuals in California, Northeast Oklahoma, and Southwest Missouri.
Using Mexican sources of supply, Jacobo managed the distribution of methamphetamine, controlling pricing, methods of delivery, and payments. From 2016 to 2021, he received bulk shipments of meth in California and oversaw the transportation of the drugs to Oklahoma and Missouri, sometimes in quantities as large as 200 pounds. Cash proceeds were sent back to California, either driven by co-conspirators or mailed in sums of up to $100,000 from Oklahoma.
Three distinct drug conspiracies were operated by Jacobo's regional managers in Oklahoma, each selling methamphetamine under his direction. Numerous pieces of evidence, including communications and money exchanges related to the conspiracies, were presented during the trial, along with evidence from executed search warrants.
One significant discovery came when law enforcement uncovered 231 pounds of methamphetamine and over $465,000 in a storage unit in Grove, Oklahoma, in 2020. The storage unit was rented for Jacobo to store meth for distribution. In addition, officers arrested a codefendant, Tony Garcia, who was carrying 30 pounds of meth and a loaded handgun in Oklahoma City. Text messages on Garcia's phone indicated that he received instructions from Jacobo on the meth distribution.
Jacobo's conviction was the result of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Operation ""Pullin Chains,"" led by the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Drug Enforcement Administration. This operation targeted high-level drug traffickers and criminal organizations, employing a multi-agency approach to disrupt and dismantle these networks.

"Emy Afalava is a loyal American and decorated veteran.  He was born in American Samoa, a U.S. territory since 1900. He has been subject to American law his whole life and thinks he should be a citizen. The Constitution would agree.  The Fourteenth Amendment declares that ""All persons born ... in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States."" Yet, Afalava has been denied the right to vote because the federal government insists that he is no citizen.  How can it be, in the 21st century, that Americans born on U.S. soil are denied the rights of citizenship? That injustice clouds the recent celebration of the 115th anniversary of the decision of American Samoa to join the United States.  It is a wrong that Afalava and other American Samoans are now seeking to right in a federal lawsuit before the D.C. Circuit. A decision could come any day. Since the United States was established, it adhered to the rule that those born on U.S. lands were U.S. citizens.  The rule is colorblind, yet the only exception that the Supreme Court has ever declared was not. The infamous Dred Scott case legitimized slavery as it declared that free African-Americans had ""no rights that the white man was bound to respect.""  Though they were Americans, they were not citizens under the Constitution. A Civil War later, the 14th Amendment reversed the ruling in the Dred Scott case. Today, the Dred Scott case has come to be regarded as one of the worst decisions in the history of the Supreme Court. But racial discrimination didn't end there. In 1904, a Puerto Rican woman named Isabel Gonzalez sailed for New York.  Because Puerto Rico was U.S. territory, she believed herself to be a U.S. citizen.  But officials at Ellis Island labeled her an undesirable alien and prevented her from entering the mainland.  She sued, with some reason to hope for a favorable ruling. Yet the Supreme Court that eventually heard Gonzalez's case was still racist.  In preceding years, for example, it had permitted a flat ban on naturalizing anyone of the Chinese race. And, in a case addressing the status of recently acquired island territories such as Puerto Rico, the justices had cited the alleged racial inferiority of tropical peoples as reason to treat these lands as second-class U.S. territories.  Justice Edward Douglas White's opinion stated that U.S. sovereignty extended over them, but that their residents did not hold the same constitutional rights as other Americans.  He did so, he privately revealed, because ""he was much preoccupied by the danger of racial and social questions."" In the Gonzalez case, the justices agreed unanimously that Puerto Ricans were not aliens and thus not subject to immigration laws.  But they declined to decide whether or not Gonzalez was a citizen.  Though preoccupied by fears that islanders were ""savages"" and racially unfit for citizenship, they were unwilling to violate the Constitution. As a result of the court ruling, federal officials were able to deny Gonzalez and others the full panoply of rights conferred on citizens for years. As Isabel Gonzalez's lawyer told the Court, declaring that residents of America's island territories are not U.S. citizens would mean adding to ""precedents in our history of which we are least proud."" Those precedents, he warned the Court, had been ""repudiated by the American people in the Civil War, by three amendments to the Constitution of the United States, by this court, and by ... advancing civilization."" Surely, 147 years after the Dred Scott case was overturned, the time has come to put an end to this farce. In the past century, the inhabitants of every other U.S. island territory have become citizens. Today, Emy Afalava and his fellow American Samoans are the last Americans still waiting to become citizens.

"[1] The Tar Baby is a decoy object from the 1946 Disney film Song of the South, the animated segments of which are based on the Uncle Remus stories compiled by Joel Chandler Harris. Although its provenance rests in African folklore, the term ""tar baby"" is viewed by some Americans as having a negative connotation towards African Americans. This controversy, among other alleged racial issues, has prevented the release of the movie on home video, or streaming service in the United States.

[2] A Slate article highlights some of the problematic elements of the film, where, ""it's implied that the black workers are no longer Johnny's family's property, [but] they are still completely subservient, and happily so.""A CinemaBlend article adds: ""Beyond that, Song of the South deals with the use of racist dialects, as well as the use of the trope that would later become known as the ""magical negro."" Even the animated sequences aren't free of controversy. One of Br'er Fox's plans to capture Br'er Rabbit involves the use of a golem made of black tar which the fox refers to as a ...tar baby.""

[3] The Oxford English Dictionary (but not the print version of its American counterpart) says that tar baby is a derogatory term used for ""a black or a Maori.""

[4] An important point to make about Song of the South – and a lot of controversial art, for that matter – is that it’s not an act of PC revisionism to call out its prejudices, because plenty of people were doing so at the time, too. Disney produced the film over the objections of the NAACP and the American Council on Race Relations, and rejected efforts to soften the script by the southern-born writer Dalton Reymond. And it was released to picket lines in some cities and some scathing criticism from reviewers, politicians and other black advocacy groups.",This character reinforces stereotypes about African Americans and contributes to the negative imagery surrounding people of color.,0,1,0.5477666258811951

"A point in Bosnia-Herzegovina on Saturday or at home to Andorra three days later would see Wales end their 57-year absence from major tournaments.
Gunter, 26, believes the current side can deliver where previous generations have fallen short.
""It's been a hard time. We aren't the biggest nation but we've probably underachieved,"" said the defender.
""I remember Romania [1993] and the Russia campaign [2003], the closer we get over the years, the more these questions seem to come.
""It's nice to be involved in the right sort of scenarios towards the end of the group. We played Belgium when they celebrated getting to the [2014] World Cup and we've put ourselves in that position now.""
Wales are a point clear at the summit of Group B, with the top two teams qualifying automatically for Euro 2016.
Even if they lose their final two qualifiers - unlikely as Andorra have never won a competitive game away from home - Wales would still reach next summer's tournament if Israel fail to win both of their remaining fixtures against Cyprus and group favourites Belgium.
With the insurance of a home game against Andorra on Tuesday, the odds of qualification are overwhelmingly in Wales' favour.
But Gunter is mindful of previous failures and says Wales will be aiming to seal their place in France with a positive result against Bosnia on Saturday.
""The near misses are there as a reminder that in football even the most unlikely thing can happen until the job is done,"" he added.
""We've worked so hard for so long, it'd be a massive mistake to get complacent and think the job is done.
""If we start thinking we'll be celebrating on Saturday night we'll be caught out. It's a really tough game. We have done well because we've always prepared in the right way.
""Until we've qualified we have to concentrate as anything can happen.""
Gareth Bale has been integral to Wales' recent success, scoring six of their nine goals in this campaign, and a calf injury had made the Real Madrid forward a doubt for the forthcoming double-header.
But he returned for his club side against Atletico Madrid on Sunday and is expected to feature against Bosnia and Andorra.
""Gareth is here, he's fit, he's done the same as everybody else. It's brilliant news for us and the gaffer [Chris Coleman] as well,"" said Gunter.
""I don't think if he's fit and here we'll look beyond the game at the weekend. It'd be a brave man to tell him he's not playing Saturday!
""If he's fit I'm sure he'll be involved and hopefully in the same form as the rest of the campaign.""",Wales defender chris gunter says it would be a `` massive mistake'' to get complacent as they close in on euro 2016.,1,1,0.9665685892105103
"[1] In computing, a crash, or system crash, occurs when a computer program such as a software application or an operating system stops functioning properly and exits. On some operating systems or individual applications, a crash reporting service will report the crash and any details relating to it (or give the user the option to do so), usually to the developer(s) of the application. If the program is a critical part of the operating system, the entire system may crash or hang, often resulting in a kernel panic or fatal system error.

"New York (CNN)A New York Police Department detective apologized Friday for an angry exchange with an Uber driver that was caught on video and landed him on modified assignment. ""I apologize. I sincerely apologize,"" Patrick Cherry told WNBC's Jonathan Dienst. Cherry, an NYPD detective assigned to the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force with top-secret security clearance, faces suspension, reassignment or loss of his clearance after the video of the altercation went viral. ""I was just angry, at that moment, for that exchange."" Cherry said. ""If the conversation initially went differently, we probably would have shook hands at the end of that encounter."" The altercation began Monday when the Uber driver gestured to a detective in an unmarked car to use his blinker after he was allegedly attempting to park without using it, according to Sanjay Seth, a passenger in the car who uploaded the video to YouTube. The video picks up seconds after the detective began yelling at the driver and mocking his accent, and also shows the unmarked car with lights flashing pulled over behind the Uber car. In the video, the detective tells the driver he has committed ""three traffic and law violations""  and then becomes irate and uses expletives toward the comparably calm driver. A visibly upset Police Commissioner William Bratton on Wednesday said the detective was placed on modified assignment pending an investigation. ""No good cop can watch that without a wince,"" he told reporters. ""As all good cops know ... the officer made their jobs a little bit harder. That kind of anger like that is unacceptable in any encounter; discourtesy like that and language like that is unacceptable. That officer's behavior reflected poorly on everyone who wears our uniform."" Cherry also apologized to the police commissioner, saying ""he's doing a lot of good work to strengthen community relations in the city and I set that back. I would work, personally work to fix that."" ""You can't judge three minutes of a tape involving me and me alone as indication that that's the kind of practice of the New York City Police Department,"" he added. Bratton, who said the detective was on duty at the time, issued an apology to the driver and passengers. Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters at an unrelated news conference that he had not seen the video. ""There's just no place for any public servant to use discriminatory or negative language,"" he said. ""Obviously, our police play a particularly sensitive role and need to show respect for all people."" In a statement, Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives' Endowment Association, called the officer ""a person of good character and an excellent detective"" who ""should not be judged by one isolated incident."" ""I am not trying to minimize the significance of what occurred,"" Palladino said. ""I am simply pointing out that cops are just like everyone else. They have families, friends and other things going on in their lives, too, that may affect their behavior at times. There is no disputing that we are held to a higher standard, that is why this incident is so newsworthy."" In the video, after the detective steps back to his car, the Uber driver, who moved to America less than two years ago, turns to the passenger and thanks him for recording the video. ""That's crazy. That's really inappropriate,"" the passenger tells the driver. ""Listen, it's not your fault. He shouldn't be slamming your car door, throwing things around. He doesn't have a right to open your door."" When the detective comes back, he is irate and doesn't allow the driver to speak. ""I don't care what you have to say, people are allowed to park their cars on the side of the street without your interference,"" the detective tells the driver. ""I don't know where you're coming from, where you think it's appropriate in doing that. That's the way it works."" ""I've got news for you,"" the detective says, ""the only reason you're not in handcuffs and going to jail and getting summons in the precinct is because I have things to do. That's the only reason that's not happening. Because this isn't important enough for me. You're not important enough. Don't ever do that again."" The NYPD said the Internal Affairs Bureau is investigating the incident. ""The behavior in the video is wrong and unacceptable and we appreciate the NYPD investigating the incident. We are in touch with our driver-partner who was subjected to this terrible experience and will continue to provide any support he needs,"" Uber said Tuesday. Seth met Wednesday with an investigator from the Civilian Complaint Review Board, according to board spokeswoman Linda Sachs. The investigator is attempting to interview the driver as well as the police officer. The findings will be presented to the board, which will make an official determination on whether misconduct was committed, Sachs said. The board will either refer the decision to the NYPD with a disciplinary recommendation, or decide to bring up the officer on administrative charges, with the decision presented to the police commissioner. CNN's Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.

"For Educators
Public schools may not teach religion, although teaching about religion in a secular context is permitted. 1 The Bible may be taught in a school, but only for its historical, cultural or literary value and never in a devotional, celebratory or doctrinal manner, or in such a way that encourages acceptance of the Bible as a religious document. 2
Religion may be presented as part of a secular educational program. Programs that ""teach about religion"" are geared toward teaching students about the role of religion in the historical, cultural, literary and social development of the United States and other nations. These programs should instill understanding, tolerance and respect for a pluralistic society. When discussing religion in this context, religion must be discussed in a neutral, objective, balanced and factual manner. Such programs should educate students about the principle of religious liberty as one of the fundamental elements of freedom and democracy in the United States.
""Teaching religion"" amounts to religious indoctrination or practice and is clearly prohibited in public schools. A public school curriculum may not be devotional or doctrinal. 3 Nor may it have the effect of promoting or inhibiting religion. A teacher must not promote or denigrate any particular religion, religion in general, or lack of religious belief. 4 A teacher must not interject personal views or advocate those of certain students. Teachers must be extremely sensitive to respect, and not interfere with, a student's religious beliefs and practices. Students must not be encouraged to accept or conform to specific religious beliefs or practices. A program intended to teach religion, disguised as teaching about religion, will be found unconstitutional. 5
In sum, there is a critical difference between teaching religion and teaching about religion. While it is constitutionally permissible for public schools to teach about religion, it is unconstitutional for public schools and their employees to observe religious holidays, promote religious belief, or practice religion. School officials and parents must be extremely careful not to cross the line between ""the laudable educational goal of promoting a student's knowledge of and appreciation for this nation's cultural and religious diversity, and the impermissible endorsement of religion forbidden by the Establishment Clause."" 6
The Bible may be studied as literature, but not as religious doctrine. The lesson must be secular, religiously neutral and objective. 7 Classes on the Bible as literature should be optional. 8 The Anti-Defamation League strongly suggests that such classes be taught by school personnel who have some training in Establishment Clause issues.
Schools may indeed and should teach secular values such as honesty, respect for others, courage, kindness and good citizenship. These values, however, must not be taught as religious tenets. The fact that most religions also teach these values does not change the lawfulness and desirability of teaching them. It is also appropriate for school officials to instill in students such values as ""independent thought, tolerance of diverse views, self-respect, maturity, self-reliance and logical decision-making."" 9
Although it is legal to teach about religion in public schools in a neutral and secular manner, school administrators, teachers and parents should be cognizant of the inherent dangers of bringing religion into the classroom. 10 Public school teachers should carefully consider the following factors:
- Students are extremely susceptible to peer and public pressure and coercion. This concern is heightened, of course, at the elementary school level. Any discussion of religion in the classroom should be sensitive to the beliefs of the different students in the class. No student should be made to feel that his or her personal beliefs or practices are being questioned, infringed upon or compromised. A student should never feel ostracized on the basis of his or her religious beliefs.
- If religion is discussed, great care must be taken to discuss minority as well as majority religions. The inclusion of only the major religions in a classroom discussion does not reflect the actual religious diversity within our society and the world. Cursory discussions will subtly denigrate the validity of minority religious beliefs held by some individuals, regardless of whether adherents to minority beliefs are represented in the class. If they are present, these students may feel excluded or coerced.
- Students should not be put on the spot to explain their religious (or cultural) traditions. The student may feel uncomfortable and may not have enough information to be accurate. Moreover, by asking a student to be spokesperson for his or her religion, the teacher is sending a signal that the religion is too ""exotic"" for the teacher to understand. Finally, in certain cases, the teacher may be opening the door for proselytizing activity by the student, which must be avoided.
- Every effort should be made to obtain accurate information about different religions. Special training may be required to prepare teachers to discuss religion in an appropriate manner.
- Discussion of religion in the classroom may alienate those students who are being raised with no religious faith. While there is an obligation for even these students to learn what is being taught as part of a secular educational program, it is very important that teachers avoid discussions that seem to endorse religious belief over non-religious belief. Otherwise, such students may feel pressure to conform to the majority, or be made to feel inferior about their own upbringing.
- Discussion of religion in the classroom may alienate those who are being raised with orthodox religious faiths. It is equally important that teachers not appear to disapprove of faith, thereby alienating those who are raised with faith.
No. Public schools can require that all students use a prescribed set of textbooks if the books neither promote nor oppose any religious practice. The students must only be required to read and discuss the material and may not be required to perform or refrain from performing any act forbidden or mandated by their religion. Mere exposure to ideas that one finds objectionable on religious grounds does not rise to the level of a free exercise claim that compelled activity would. 11
The state may not establish a ""religion of secularism"" in the sense that the state may not affirmatively oppose or show hostility to religion, thereby preferring those who believe in no religion over those who do believe. 12 That being said, the prohibition on teaching religion and religious activity ensures that the government does not advance or promote religious belief over non-religious belief or a particular religious belief over other religious beliefs. 13 Simply, the public schools should work to ensure that they do not endorse or disapprove religion, neither promoting nor denigrating it.
This is as much a free speech issue as it is a religious liberty issue. Where a student responds to an assignment (for example, a book report) with a religiously-themed project (for example, reporting on a religious tract), a school may not refuse to accept the assignment solely because it has a religious basis (students have a right to free expression). 14 However, if in observing the presentation of the assignment -- especially expressive assignments like artwork, plays and reports that are presented publicly -- an observer might think that the project is endorsed by the school, it is a problem. 15 Thus, a book report delivered to a teacher may not be rejected merely because it is religious, whereas a work of art that will be hung up or displayed by the school or a play intended for public performance is unacceptable. Indeed, educators are able to exercise considerable control over ""student expression to assure that participants learn whatever lessons the activity is designed to teach, that readers or listeners are not exposed to material that may be inappropriate for their level of maturity, and that the views of the individual speaker are not erroneously attributed to the school."" 16
Mr. Clark's sixth grade class used a standard reader which had stories on a wide variety of topics. One passage in the reader involved the first settlers in the ""new world,"" and another described Leonardo da Vinci as the human with a creative mind that ""came closest to the divine touch."" Talia Berk, a student in Mr. Clark's class, was interested in the passage about the first settlers and asked how the religious beliefs and practices of these settlers compared with those of the Native American Indians.
How should Mr. Clark answer Talia's question on the settlers?
After researching the question, the teacher may explain the answer to Talia in a secular, objective and nondoctrinal manner, or recommend a book on the subject which is secular, unbiased and nondoctrinal.
Joe Smith, also a student in Mr. Clark's class, showed the reader referenced in the prior scenario to his mother, who became very upset with the passage on Leonardo da Vinci, since she viewed it as contrary to her religious beliefs. Joe's mother asked Mr. Clark to excuse Joe from using the reader. Mr. Clark, unsure of how to respond to Mrs. Smith's request, went to the principal to seek guidance.
Should Joe be exempted from using the standard reader?
The school should not excuse Joe from using the standard reader. However, the school must ensure that the standard reader neither promotes nor opposes religion, and that Joe is merely required to read and discuss the material and is not required to perform or refrain from performing any act forbidden or mandated by his religion.
Mr. Parker, who is not Jewish, is afraid that he will mischaracterize Hanukkah when he is explaining about holidays. In class, he calls on a Jewish student to see if she would be willing to explain to the class the meaning of Hanukkah. She tries to do so. Later that day, the student tells her mother about the incident, who objects to Mr. Parker. Mr. Parker proposes that the mother come to class and explain Hanukkah. She agrees and comes to school and performs a holiday-foods cooking demonstration.
Should Mr. Parker have asked the student to explain Hanukkah? Should he have asked her mother?
By asking the student, Mr. Parker singled her out from her peers and made Hanukkah seem too exotic for him to explain. It is also unlikely that many students would have the requisite knowledge to give an accurate answer. By asking the mother, Mr. Parker rightly shifted the burden off of the student to an adult. However, he must make sure that the presentation given by the mother is neutral, objective and fits in with a broader lesson plan concerning the holidays. Better still, Mr. Parker could avail himself of one of the many books about Hanukkah and prepare himself to teach the lesson.

"Crowds who turned out for the Anzac Day memorial service at Sydney’s Martin Place have been left fuming after the Ivy nightclub played loud dance music during the minute’s silence.

"names of such instruments, their intent was the same: to expropriate indigenous lands and facilitate their transfer to the colonizing or dominating nation.

It was indisputable that such principles were clearly based on racist and unscientific assumptions, he said, which explained the repeated and compelling calls for the General Assembly to renounce such documents, and to make it clear that they were illegitimate, and could not be used by States as claims to indigenous lands, territories or natural resources. Assembly action was essential because of the false position that territorial sovereignty asserted under those doctrines was a fact — a “we’re sorry, we can’t do anything about it” approach. On the issue of temporality, there was a view that unlawfulness must be determined by prevailing law at a given time, he said, but which law: that of the colonizer or the indigenous people?

"[1] Since the bicycle was invented, s cientists have postulated various reasons as to why a bicycle is self stable above a certain speed. The consensus has been that a bicycle's stability is related to two factors: First, the rotating wheels of the bicycle provide stability through gyroscopic effects; secondly, that the ‘trail’, the distance by which the contact point of the front wheel trails behind the steering axis, plays an important part.A new study in Science claims to have settled the issue - gyroscopic effects and trail help, says researcher Dr Arend Schwab of the 3mE faculty at TU Delft, but are not necessary above a certain speed . In a 2007 Proceedings of the Royal Society article (doi:10.1098/rspa.2007.1857), a mathematical model with around 25 physical parameters was developed at the time which appeared to predict whether, and at what speeds, a particular design of bicycle would be stable.

[2] A bicycle, on the other hand, is statically unstable because it only has two contact points with the ground (whatever portion of the front and back wheels happen to be touching the ground) and its base of support is a line segment. A good base of support needs at least three contact points with the ground, so bikes are hard to keep upright when they're still. Bikes are, however, dynamically stable, or stable when moving forward, because steering allows a rider to move the bike's points of support around under the center of gravity and keep it balanced, often with steering adjustments small enough that the rider may not even realize they're making them. It's sort of like standing on one foot. If you don't hop around a little, and you start falling sideways, you can't recover and you fall over. If you do hop, though, you can move your foot around to keep your center of gravity above it and keep your balance.
A bike has two features that help this dynamic stability immensely: its wheels. Spinning wheels have angular momentum, and when you're sitting on a bike, you and it and its wheels make up a system that obeys the principle of conservation of angular momentum. Unless torque, or twisting force, is applied from outside the system to change the wheels' angular momentum, that momentum and the direction of the momentum remain constant. In a nutshell, once the wheels line up a certain way, they want to stay lined up like that. It's easy for you to move them, but hard for an outside force to do the same, and so the bike is easy to keep balanced but doesn't topple easily. A non-moving bike has wheels that aren't spinning and zero angular momentum, which makes it very easy for external torque to change the wheels' direction, making the bike harder to balance.",A good base of support needs three contact points.,1,1,0.9748489260673523
"Speaker 4: Motion carries. Thank you very much. Thank you. And we will. We're going to go ahead and move on to item 12, please. Just the next item on the agenda.
Speaker 0: Item two, I was communication from Councilwoman Price, Councilmember Spano, Councilman Andrews and Councilmember Turanga. Recommendation to require a city manager to develop a free voluntary bike registration program by partnering with Project 5 to 9.
Speaker 4: Thank you. I can have everyone just say we're going to keep moving the agenda as we exit. So please. Councilwoman Price.
Speaker 6: I'm not. Is there anyone left from public works that might be able to.
Speaker 1: Speak about this?
Speaker 4: I know Mr. Beck is here. Do we want to grab Mr. Beck? We're going to grab Mr.. Mr.. Beck.
Speaker 1: This is a quick one.
Speaker 6: Well, I'll go ahead and get started since I think our colleagues have probably read the TFF already, but I'm glad to be bringing this item back before the City Council to establish a city wide bike registration program. As you may recall, I brought the initial item before council asking staff to provide a report on the feasibility of developing a free online voluntary bicycle registration program. They Richards staff returned with a report on March the eighth recommending that a bike registration organization called Project 5 to 9 would offer the greatest ability to deliver a robust, low cost bicycle registry program to our residents. Since 2011, the city has not required registration of bicycles. The registration program was cumbersome and difficult for residents to comply with. However, today, bicycle thefts are serious and growing concern throughout Long Beach. So a new approach is needed. Currently, many residents do not record this information for their bicycles, so if their bicycle is stolen, they are unable to provide the police department with detailed information that could result in the return of the bicycle. Additionally, if a bicycle is registered.
Speaker 1: The.
Speaker 6: Police department would be better able to proactively return stolen bikes to their owners when they are found, as well as prosecute those committing bike thefts. The police department currently has a large number of recovered bicycles that are unregistered, with no way of contacting the owners. And free and voluntary online bike registration programs.
Speaker 1: Will give.
Speaker 9: The police.
Speaker 6: Department a better chance of returning stolen bikes and confronting the.
Speaker 1: Bike theft problem head.
Speaker 6: On. Addressing bike thefts has become a big focus for me because every day we see bikes stolen and there is little the police can do to address this. If they cannot prove ownership of a bike and the crime goes unreported, stolen bikes are chronically used as currency for drug purchases, primarily the drugs that we've seen them used for purchases for as heroin and methamphetamine. So bike registration gives police an important tool to fight a number of issues, while also improving our ability to return bikes to their owners. The costs for us to be involved in this program is minimal, considering that we're servicing a city of 500,000 residents. And I see that Mr. Becker's here. So I don't know if Mr. Beck wants to offer any additional comments that I didn't cover.
Speaker 4: Councilmember Apologize. Yes. I think moving forward with an online bicycle program is the best approach. We have worked with our colleagues in the police department. They are very supportive of going in this direction and we look forward to getting it up and running for the community in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 6: Thank you. I don't have any further comments. I ask my colleagues to support us. This is, in my opinion, as as our city manager often says, motherhood and apple pie. Thank you.
Speaker 3: Thank you, Councilmember Supernormal.
Speaker 4: I support.
Speaker 3: This item.
Speaker 4: Wholeheartedly.
Speaker 3: Thank you, Councilman Andrew.
Speaker 11: Yes. And I want to thank Councilman Price for bringing this item, you know, to the diary, because the free bicycle registration program, I think it's a step in the right direction because we always kind of brag about our Long Beach bike friendly city. But our infrastructure is intact. Isn't the most effective regarding bike ownership or theft? You know, I believe a streamlined process for this registration will support our recovery effort and hopefully encourage more residents to ride their bikes. So I'm excited about seeing this progress in program, you know, coming to action. Thank you, Councilman Price.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)As the transport plane comes in to land at Sanaa Airport, the deep scars of the brutal conflict tearing Yemen apart are only too clear: wrecked aircraft line the runway, and nearby buildings lie in ruins. To most of the outside world, this war-torn country is off limits, the weeks-long battle between Houthi rebels and Saudi-led coalition forces making it too dangerous to visit, and a no-fly zone rendering its international airport all but obsolete -- but on Tuesday, CNN was granted rare access on a desperate aid mission by Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund. The airport has previously been bombed. Hostilities are likely to resume before the day is out: a brief, peaceful window has been delicately negotiated following a special request from the U.N. -- but it won't last long. Unicef hopes there will be just enough time to deliver vital food and supplies, helping to ease the country's worsening humanitarian crisis. More than 100,000 Yemeni civilians have fled their homes since fighting began, and OCHA, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, estimates that 15.9 million people here are in need of assistance. The main terminal at El Rahaba Airport is under the control of the Houthi rebels. We can't get near it for fear of provoking trouble. But there is plenty to be done out on the tarmac. Within minutes of touching down, a small army of aid workers is busy unloading huge mounds of much-needed provisions. Gusts of wind blow dust across the runway, as crates and pallets of emergency nutrition and medical equipment pile up rapidly beside the plane. Unicef's team has overcome more than one hurdle just getting it this far -- now they'll have to work out how to distribute it to those most in need in a country paralyzed by a lack of resources. Even before Saudi airstrikes, most of the 25 million people in Yemen required humanitarian assistance to meet their most basic needs, according to the United Nations. As they work, an Air India plane is taxiing away from the terminal. Thousands have fled the country on evacuation flights in recent weeks as the situation in Yemen has deteriorated. But for those who have nowhere else to go and no chance of a flight out, mercy missions by Unicef and other NGOs like it are the only hope.

We put a lot of demands on our wrists every day. From typing on keyboards to using handheld devices, our wrists are constantly in motion. These repetitive tasks can cause carpal tunnel syndrome, a condition in which the median nerve in the wrist, which runs from the forearm to the hand, is compressed. This compression can cause pain, numbness, and tingling in the hand and wrist.
A brace is one of the most common treatments for carpal tunnel. The brace helps immobilize the wrist and remove pressure on the nerve. Wearing a brace is an effective way to treat this condition and provide relief from its symptoms. This blog post will discuss what carpal tunnel is, what causes it, and how a wrist brace can help.
Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition that affects the hands and wrists. A narrow passageway on the palm side of your wrist is called the carpal tunnel. It protects the median nerve, which runs from your forearm to your hand. The median nerve controls sensation and muscle movement in your thumb and first three fingers. Anything that puts pressure on or compresses the median nerve can cause carpal tunnel syndrome.
Carpal tunnel pain typically starts gradually and worsens over time. Symptoms of carpal tunnel include numbness, tingling, pain, and weakness in the hands and wrists. It can also weaken the muscles of the hand and make it difficult to grip objects. If left untreated, carpal tunnel syndrome can permanently damage the median nerve.
While the exact cause of carpal tunnel syndrome is still unknown, experts believe some patients may be predisposed to developing the condition. For example, an individual with naturally smaller passageways may be more likely to suffer damage or irritation to the median nerve.
Additionally, pregnancy and menopause can lead to increased fluid retention, which puts additional pressure on the median nerve. Other risk factors include diabetes, arthritis, and repetitive activities. This means that people who type, text, or make repetitive hand motions on a daily basis are at risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
Furthermore, it is important to note that carpal tunnel syndrome can affect anyone, regardless of age or gender. If you are experiencing symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, consult a doctor for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.
Although carpal tunnel can be extremely painful, several conservative treatment options can provide relief. Wrist splints and braces help treat carpal tunnel by immobilizing the wrist to remove pressure on the median nerve. These devices help support the wrist and hold it in a neutral position. They also limit the wrist's range of motion to allow it to heal. Wrist splints and braces help reduce the pain and inflammation associated with the condition.
Wrist braces are a common treatment option for carpal tunnel syndrome, and there are many different types to choose from. If you're looking for a wrist brace that can withstand almost any activity, you should consider one of the many braces explicitly designed for carpal tunnel. These braces provide ample support and stabilization and are designed to be comfortable even during extended wear. In addition, they're often made from materials that help keep your skin cool and dry. When you are looking for a wrist splint or brace to alleviate your carpal tunnel symptoms, there are a few things you should keep in mind:
- Immobilization of the wrist: Choose a splint or brace that offers adequate support without being too constrictive.
- Material: Consider the materials from which the splint or brace is made, as some materials may cause skin irritation.
- Fit: Make sure the splint or brace fits snugly and does not slip down your arm.
- Comfort: Choose a brace that is comfortable to wear for extended periods and does not interfere with daily activities.
- Design: The brace should also be easy to put on and take off.
The standard treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome is to wear a brace for six to eight weeks. The brace holds your wrist in a position that takes the pressure off the median nerve. This gives the inflammation time to heal and the swelling to go down.
Wearing the brace at night is often recommended because that's when symptoms can be the worst. You may also need to wear the brace during the day if your symptoms are severe or if you have trouble using your hand. Some people find relief from carpal tunnel syndrome after wearing the brace for just a few weeks, but it may take longer for others.
It depends on the severity of the condition. For mild cases of carpal tunnel, a loose-fitting brace may be all that is needed to provide symptom relief. However, a tighter-fitting brace may be necessary for more severe cases to immobilize the wrist and prevent further damage to the median nerve. Ultimately, it is important to work with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of treatment for your case of carpal tunnel.
For many people, carpal tunnel is a temporary condition that can be effectively treated with conservative measures. If you're experiencing carpal tunnel pain after splinting the wrist, ice therapy, and anti-inflammatory medication, see a doctor for an evaluation. A variety of treatment options are available, including steroid injections and surgery. The best treatment option will depend on the underlying cause of the carpal tunnel. Early diagnosis and treatment can help reduce the risk of long-term complications such as weakness and loss of sensation in the hand.
Traditional wrist braces can be bulky, uncomfortable, and challenging to wear. They also don't allow your skin to breathe, leading to irritation and sweating.
Cas21 is a new cast alternative designed to support and relieve pressure on the median nerve. One of the benefits of our product is that it provides waterproof support. This means you can still participate in activities such as swimming or bathing while wearing our cast alternative. In addition, the product is made from breathable materials, which helps reduce skin irritation. Our cast alternative is also easier to put on and take off than a traditional cast, making it an ideal option for people with carpal tunnel syndrome.
Cast21 is perfect for those who want to avoid surgery or are looking for an alternative to traditional wrist braces. If you suffer from painful and disruptive wrist pain from carpal tunnel syndrome, ask your doctor if Cast21 can help prevent permanent nerve damage.
If you have any questions about our cast alternative, contact us. We can provide information about finding a healthcare provider who can approve you for Cast21 and answer any other questions you may have.",You should wear them sparingly during the day unless instructed otherwise by a doctor.,1,0,0.015185604803264141

I went to the front and asked them if that plate on the rack was for us and they said that it just came out and were waiting for my pasta to come out.

Our plates arrived and we just looked at each other as the rice was in clumps.  Literally.  The rice and beans were cold to the touch and when we cut into the chicken it was RAW.   Dark pink RAW.  We called over the server and she apologized and took it back.  The same plates were returned with the same pieces of chicken grilled to a near burnt crisp (chefs revenge I\'m guessing) and the rice and beans were still cold.  We called over the server to let her know and one of the owners came over to apologize.   We told her that we REALLY want to like this place as we LOVED Cabo\'s but the standards of the restaurant need to start with the standards in the kitchen and there is just NO care for the food here.

"[1] The presidential birth requirements in the U.S. Constitution require anyone elected to serve as U.S. president or vice president be a ""natural born citizen."" What that means is only those people who are U.S. citizens at birth and did not have to go through the naturalization process are eligible to serve in the highest office in the land. It does not mean that a president must have been born on U.S. soil to serve, even though there has never been a U.S. president born outside one of the 50 U.S. states.

[2] In order to be eligible to serve as president, a person must either have been born on U.S. soil or (if born overseas) to at least one parent who is a citizen. The Framers clearly intended to exclude any chance of foreign influence from the highest administrative position in the federal government.

[3] Though their concerns may now seem archaic, the framers were genuinely afraid of foreign subversion. Among their nightmare scenarios was the prospect of a European noble using his money and influence to sway the Electoral College, take command of the American army, and return the nascent nation to the royalist fold. At the time, several European figures—such as France’s Marquis de Lafayette, a hero of the Revolutionary War—were quite popular in the New World, so the idea wasn’t completely far-fetched.

[4] The framers also took a lesson from Europe, where dynasties constantly schemed against one another. The men who drafted the Constitution were certainly familiar with the tragic example of Poland, where agents from Russia, Prussia, and Austria conspired to install a friendly monarch, Stanislaus II, and subsequently seized upon his weakness and partitioned the country among themselves. Keep in mind, too, that dynasties occasionally shuffled around Europe regardless of national origin; England’s King George I, for example, was a Hanoverian who spoke zero English.", The framers of the U.S. Constitution wanted to ensure that the nation’s highest office was not subject to foreign influence or the machinations of European royal families.,1,1,0.9037566781044006

"Fingers crossed the event will more resemble Mir's end than Skylab's.

It took NASA and its partners nearly four dozen trips between 1998 and 2010 to haul the roughly 900,000 pounds worth of various modules into orbit that make up the $100 billion International Space Station. But come the end of this decade, more than 30 years after the first ISS component broke atmosphere, the ISS will reach the end of its venerable service life and be decommissioned in favor of a new, privately-operated cadre of orbital research stations .
The problem NASA faces is what to do with the ISS once it’s been officially shuttered, because it’s not like we can just leave it where it is. Without regular shipments of propellant reactant to keep the station on course, the ISS’ orbit would eventually degrade to the point where it’s forward momentum would be insufficient to overcome the effects of atmospheric drag , subsequently plummeting back to Earth. So, rather than wait for the ISS to de-orbit on its own, or leave it in place for the Russians to use as target practice , NASA will instead cast down the station from upon high like Vader did Palpatine.
NASA is no stranger to getting rid of refuse via atmospheric incineration . The space agency has long relied on it in order to dispose of trash, expended launch vehicles, and derelict satellites. Both America’s Skylab and Russia’s Mir space stations were decommissioned in this manner.
Skylab was America’s first space station, for the whole 24 weeks it was in use. When the final 3-astronaut crew departed in early 1974, the station was boosted one last time to 6.8 miles further out in a 289-mile graveyard orbit . It was expected to remain there until the 1980s when increased solar activity from the waxing 11-year solar cycle would eventually drag it down into a fiery reentry. However, astronomers miscalculated the relative strength of that solar event, which pushed up Skylab’s demise to 1979.

In 1978, NASA toyed with the idea of using its soon-to-be-completed Space Shuttle to help boost Skylab into a higher orbit but abandoned the plan when it became clear that the Shuttle wouldn’t be finished in time, given the accelerated reentry timetable. The agency also rejected a proposal to blow the station up with missiles while still in orbit. The station eventually came down on July 11th, 1979, though it didn’t burn up in the atmosphere as quickly as NASA had predicted. This caused some rather large pieces of debris to overshoot the intended Indian Ocean target South-Southeast of South Africa and instead land in Perth, Australia. Despite NASA’s calculations of a 1 in 152 chance that a piece of the lab could hit someone during its de-orbit, no injuries were reported.
Mir's deorbit went much more smoothly. After 15 years of service it was brought down on March 23rd, 2001, in three stages. First, its orbit was allowed to degrade to an altitude of 140 miles. Then, the Progress M1-5 spacecraft — basically an attachable rocket designed specifically to help deorbit the station — docked with the Mir. It subsequently lit its engine for a little over 22 minutes to precisely put the Mir down over a distant expanse of the Pacific Ocean, east of Fiji.
As for the ISS’ oncoming demise, NASA has a plan — or at least a pretty good idea — for what’s going to happen. ""We've done a lot of studies,"" Kirk Shireman, deputy manager of NASA's space station program, told Space.com in 2011. ""We have found an orbit and a change in velocity that we believe is achievable, and it creates a debris footprint that’s all in water in an unpopulated area.""
According to NASA standards — specifically NASA-STD-8719.14A, Process for Limiting Orbital Debris — the risk of human casualty on the ground is limited to less than 1 in 10,000 (< 0.0001). However, a 1998 study conducted by the ISS Mission Integration Office discovered that an uncontrolled reentry would carry an unacceptable casualty probability of between .024 to .077 (2 in 100 to 8 in 100). A number of controllable decommissioning alternatives have been discussed over the decades, including boosting the ISS farther into orbit in the event of an unexpected evacuation of the station’s crew.
""We've been working on plans and update the plans periodically,"" Shireman continued. ""We don’t want to ever be in a position where we couldn’t safely deorbit the station. It's been a part of the program from the very beginning.""
Beginning about a year before the planned decommissioning date, NASA will allow the ISS to begin degrading from its normal 240-mile high orbit and send up an uncrewed space vehicle (USV) to dock with the station and help propel it back Earthward. The ultimate crew from the ISS will evacuate just before the station hits an altitude of 115 miles, at which point the attached USV will fire its rockets in a series of deorbital burns to set the station into a capture trajectory over the Pacific Ocean.
NASA has not yet settled on which USV will be employed. A 2019 plan approved by NASA’s safety council, ASAP , relied on Roscosmos to outfit and send up another Progress spacecraft to do what it did for the Mir. However, that vehicle might not actually be available when the ISS is set to come down because Russia’s commitment to the ISS program terminates in 2024 . In April of last year, Russian state media began making noise that the country would abandon the station entirely by 2025 , potentially stripping parts from this station to reuse in its upcoming national station and leaving the ISS without a reliable way to break orbit. The ESA’s Automated Transfer Vehicle or NASA's Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, though still in development, are both potential alternatives to the Progress.
“NASA is continuing to work with its international partners to ensure a safe deorbit plan of the station and is considering a number of options,"" spokeswoman Leah Cheshier told UPI via email in 2021, declining to elaborate on what those options might entail but adding that any deorbiting mission would be ""shared by the ISS partnership and is negotiation-sensitive at this time.""
The fall of the ISS is sure to be a spectacle on par with the international hubbub surrounding Skylab’s demise , but is still nearly a decade away and there is plenty of science still left to do. According to the January 2022 International Space Station Transition report:
The ISS is now entering its third and most productive decade of utilization, including research advancement, commercial value, and global partnership. The first decade of ISS was dedicated to assembly, and the second was devoted to research and technology development and learning how to conduct these activities most effectively in space. The third decade is one in which NASA aims to verify exploration and human research technologies to support deep space exploration, continue to return medical and environmental benefits to humanity, continue to demonstrate U.S. leadership in LEO through international partnerships, and lay the groundwork for a commercial future in LEO.
More than half of the experiments performed aboard the ISS nowadays are for non-NASA users, according to the report — including nearly two dozen commercial facilities — “hundreds of experiments from other government agencies, academia, and commercial users to return benefits to people and industry on the ground.” This influx of orbital commercial activity is expected — and being actively encouraged — to further increase over the next few years until humanity can collectively realize Jeff Bezos’ dream of building a low Earth orbit mixed-use business park .
It has received approval to expand the Vegas Loop even further.
The Boring Company
Mariella Moon | @mariella_moon | May 4, 2023 1:20 AM
The Boring Company (TBC) can now officially say that it's expanding its tunnel network underneath Las Vegas by 25 miles, which will add 18 new stations to its original plan. If you'll recall, TBC, which is owned by Elon Musk, originally envisioned the Vegas Loop as an underground transportation system with 29 miles of tunnels and 51 stations. Now, the current plan is to build 65 miles of tunnels with 69 stations after the commissioners at Clark County, Nevada have approved its latest expansion.
According to TechCrunch , the commissioners voted 6-to-1 after TBC's lawyer, Stephanie Allen, assured them that the company and not the taxpayers will be paying for the project entirely. The lone dissenting vote came from Commissioner Marilyn Kirkpatrick, who raised concerns about the transit system servicing only tourists and not taking resort and casino employees into account. Apparently, Kirkpatrick has been getting calls from people her district, because it's been getting harder and harder for them to get to work due to the tunnels' construction. TBC's lawyer said the company has plans to expand to residential areas near the strip to accommodate workers.
At the moment, the Vegas Loop is still just around 2 miles long with five stops around the Las Vegas Convention Center. TBC plans to dig more tunnels connecting the network to the Harry Reid International Airport, Allegiant Stadium, downtown Las Vegas and even to Los Angeles. TechCrunch says some of the newly approved stations will be located at Las Vegas Boulevard near the airport, as well as in Chinatown, Town Square Las Vegas and Harmon Square.
The excise tax will be phased in over three years.

Mariella Moon | @mariella_moon | May 3, 2023 5:03 AM
The Biden administration wants to impose a 30 percent tax on the electricity used by cryptocurrency mining operations, and it has included the proposal in its budget for the fiscal year of 2024. In a blog post on the White House website , the administration has formally introduced the Digital Asset Mining Energy or DAME excise tax. It explained that it wants to tax cryptomining firms, because they aren't paying for the ""full cost they impose on others,"" which include environmental pollution and high energy prices.
Crypto mining has ""negative spillovers on the environment,"" the White House continued, and the pollution it generates ""falls disproportionately on low-income neighborhoods and communities of color."" It added that the operations' ""often volatile power consumption "" can raise electricity prices for the people around them and cause service interruptions. Further, local power companies are taking a risk if they decide to upgrade their equipment to make their service more stable, since miners can easily move away to another location, even abroad.
It's no secret that the process of mining cryptocurrency uses up massive amounts of electricity. In April, The New York Times published a report detailing the power used by the 34 large scale Bitcoin miners in the US that it had identified. Apparently, just those 34 operations altogether use the same amount of electricity as three million households in the country. The Times explained that most Bitcoin mining took place in China until 2021 when the country banned it, making the United State the new leader. (In the US, New York Governor Kathy Hochul signed legislation that restricts crypto mining in the state last year.) Previous reports estimated the electricity consumption related to Bitcoin alone to be more than some countries', including Argentina , Norway and the Netherlands .
As Yahoo News noted, there are other industries, such as steel manufacturing, that also use large amounts of electricity but aren't taxed for their energy consumption. In its post, the administration said that cryptomining ""does not generate the local and national economic benefits typically associated with businesses using similar amounts of electricity.""
Critics believe that the government made this proposal to go after and harm an industry it doesn't support. A Forbes report also suggested that DAME may not be the best solution for the issue, and that taxing the industry's greenhouse gas emissions might be a better alternative. That could encourage mining firms not just to minimize energy use, but also to find cleaner sources of power. It might be difficult to convince the administration to go down that route, though: In its blog post, it said that the ""environmental impacts of cryptomining exist even when miners use existing clean power."" Apparently, mining operations in communities with hydropower have been observed to reduce the amount of clean power available for use by others. That leads to higher prices and to even higher consumption of electricity from non-clean sources.
If the proposal ever becomes a law, the government would impose the excise tax in phases. It would start by adding a 10 percent tax on miners' electricity use in the first year, 20 percent in the second and then 30 percent from the third year onwards.

Musk explained it exploded after a 40-second delay.
SpaceX, YouTube
Sarah Fielding | May 1, 2023 8:00 AM
In a Twitter audio chat on Saturday, SpaceX's founder, Elon Musk, shared more details about what went awry during the first fully integrated Starship rocket and Super Heavy booster launch in April. One of the biggest revelations: The self-destruct setting took 40 seconds to work — a seemingly short time, except when you're uncertain if the massive rocket you just launched will blow up before hitting land. To recap the day's events, the rocket and booster cleared the launch pad before being unable to separate from each other, flipping and, finally, blowing up. The automated command should have immediately caused an explosion, but tumbled around for a bit first, The New York Times reported.
In one of many spins on the day's failures, Musk claimed it was because ""the vehicle’s structural margins appear to be better than we expected."" While SpaceX previously said the only goal was that initial takeoff , a lot clearly went wrong.
The delayed self-destruction wasn't the only issue following the launch from SpaceX's facility in Boca Chica, Texas. After the eventual explosion, debris fell across about 385 acres of land made up of the SpaceX facility and Boca Chica State Park. The latter resulted in a 3.5-acre fire. Musk's response? ""To the best of our knowledge there has not been any meaningful damage to the environment that we’re aware of.""
The FAA has already announced it's investigating the events and will ground Starship until ""determining that any system, process or procedure related to the mishap does not affect public safety."" Even with all of that, Musk went so far as to call the launch ""successful"" and ""maybe slightly exceeding my expectations.""
In this case, success was clearing the launch pad and, apparently, learning lessons along the way. ""The goal of these missions is just information,"" Musk said. ""Like, we don’t have any payload or anything — it’s just to learn as much as possible.""

The system aims to serve as an 'ethical' and 'legal' veneer for future military automation efforts.

Palantir already sells its domestic surveillance services to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement , so it should come as no surprise that the company founded by billionaire Peter Thiel is working to make inroads into the Pentagon as well. On Tuesday , the company released a video demo of its latest offering, the Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). While the system itself is simply designed to integrate large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-4 or Google's BERT into privately-operated networks, the very first thing they did was apply it to the modern battlefield.
In the video demo above, a military operator tasked with monitoring the Eastern European theater discovers enemy forces massing near the border and responds by asking a ChatGPT-style digital assistant for help with deploying reconnaissance drones, ginning up tactical responses to the perceived aggression and even organize the jamming of the enemy's communications. The AIP is shown helping estimate the enemy's composition and capabilities by launching a Reaper drone on a reconnaissance mission in response the to operator's request for better pictures, and suggesting appropriate responses given the discovery of an armored element.
“LLMs and algorithms must be controlled in this highly regulated and sensitive context to ensure that they are used in a legal and ethical way,” the video begins. To do so, AIP's operation is based on three ""key pillars,"" the first being that AIP will deploy across a classified system, able to parse in real-time both classified and non-classified data, ethically and legally. The company did not elaborate on how that would work. The second pillar is that users will be able to toggle the scope and actions of every LLM and asset on the network. The AIP itself will generate a secure digital record of the entire operation, ""crucial for mitigating significant legal, regulatory, and ethical risks in sensitive and classified settings,"" according to the demo. The third pillar are AIP's ""industry-leading guardrails"" to prevent the system from taking unauthorized actions.
A ""human in the loop"" to prevent such actions does exist in Palantir's scenario, though from the video, the ""operator"" appears to do little more than nod along with whatever AIP suggests. The demo also did not elaborate on what steps are being taken to prevent the LLMs that the system relies on from ""hallucinating"" pertinent facts and details.
The announcement comes hours before VP Harris meets with Silicon Valley leaders for a ""frank discussion"" about the technology's risks.

Andrew Tarantola | @terrortola | May 4, 2023 5:00 AM
Ahead of a meeting between Vice President Kamala Harris and the heads of America's four leading AI tech companies — Alphabet, OpenAI, Anthropic and Microsoft — the Biden Administration announced Thursday a sweeping series of planned actions to help mitigate some of the risks that these emerging technologies pose to the American public. That includes $140 million to launch seven new AI R&D centers as part of the National Science Foundation, extracting commitments from leading AI companies to participate in a ""public evaluation"" of their AI systems at DEFCON 31, and ordering the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to draft policy guidance for federal employees.
""The Biden Harris administration has been leading on these issues since long before these newest generative AI products debuted last fall,"" a senior administration official said during a reporters call Wednesday. The Administration unveiled its AI Bill of Rights ""blueprint"" last October , which sought to ""help guide the design, development, and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) and other automated systems so that they protect the rights of the American public,"" per a White House press release .
""At a time of rapid innovation, it is essential that we make clear the values we must advance, and the common sense we must protect,"" the administration official continued. ""With [Thursday's announcement] and the blueprint for an AI bill of rights, we've given company and policymakers and the individuals building these technologies, some clear ways that they can mitigate the risks [to consumers].""
While the federal government does already have authority to protect the citizenry and hold companies accountable , as the FTC demonstrated Monday , ""there's a lot the federal government can do to make sure we get AI right,"" the official added — like found seven brand new National AI Research Institutes as part of the NSF. They'll act to collaborate research efforts across academia, the private sector and government to develop ethical and trustworthy in fields ranging from climate, agriculture and energy, to public health, education, and cybersecurity.""
""We also need companies and innovators to be our partners in this work,"" the White House official said. ""Tech companies have a fundamental responsibility to make sure their products are safe and secure and that they protect people's rights before they're deployed or made public tomorrow.""
To that end, the Vice President is scheduled to meet with tech leaders at the White House on Thursday for what is expected to be a ""frank discussion about the risks we see in current and near-term AI development,"" the official said. ""We're also aiming to underscore the importance of their role on mitigating risks and advancing responsible innovation, and will discuss how we can work together to protect the American people from the potential harms of AI so that they can reach the benefits of these new technology.""
The Administration also announced that it has obtained ""independent commitment"" from more than a half dozen leading AI companies — Anthropic, Google, Hugging Face, Microsoft, NVIDIA, OpenAI and Stability AI — to put their AI systems up for public evaluation at DEFCON 31 (August 10-13th). There, thousands of attendees will be able to poke and prod around in these models to see if they square with the Biden admin's stated principles and practices of the Blueprint. Finally, the OMB will issue guidance to federal employees in coming months regarding official use of the technology and help establish specific policies for agencies to follow, and allow for public comment before those policies are finalized.
""These are important new steps to come out responsible innovation and to make sure AI improved people's lives, without putting rights and safety at risk,"" the official noted.","The ISS stays in orbit because it is moving forward at exactly the right speed that when combined with the pull of gravity, keeps it from falling out of orbit.",0,0,0.10242396593093872
"Tea Act, Background: In the 1760s and early 1770s, the East India Company had been required to sell its tea exclusively in London on which it paid a duty which averaged two shillings and six pence per pound. Tea destined for the North American colonies would be purchased by merchants specializing in that trade, who transported it to North America for eventual retail sale. The markups imposed by these merchants, combined with tea tax imposed by the Townshend Acts of 1767 created a profitable opportunity for American merchants to import and distribute tea purchased from the Dutch in transactions and shipments that violated the Navigation Acts and were treated by British authorities as smuggling.

We weren\'t in a huge rush, but we didn\'t have hours to dine, because I had dough proofing at home and needed to attend to it. Hubby walked in and checked in with waitress and came out saying we should take any seat we wanted and she\'d be right out with menus. So, we sat next to the Xmas tree on the patio and waited... and waited... and waited.\n\nWe figured she couldn\'t see us so we moved right next to the front door, where she couldn\'t miss us. After waiting several minutes, I decided we would wait 5 more minutes and then find somewhere else for dinner. After 3 minutes, a 30-something brunette waitress came and dropped off menus. I let her know the table was wobbly and she said she\'d bring a block for it (which she never did). Oddly, I detected a twinge of attitude from the waitress with that exchange... not sure why, but there was an element of nastiness in her tone. She also turned on the table-side heater, which was very effective, if somewhat atmosphere-killing, because of its very bright coils.\n\nI pulled up Yelp to look at the pics of the entrees and we settled on what we wanted to order. After about 5 more minutes, the waitress returned and informed us that dinner would take longer here than other restaurants. I let her know I was proofing dough at home and if we ordered immediately, how long would it take. She replied that if we ordered faster, the food would come faster. (Duh! Crazy how that works!) Again, a twinge of nastiness.\n\nHubby and I heard the specials and I asked her to repeat the sides on one of the specials. Attitude was ramping up from her. I asked her what her favorite item on the menu was and she replied, ""I can\'t say. You\'re the one who\'s going to eat it, not me! The chef wouldn\'t even tell you."" \n\nI didn\'t dare ask another question, because she was in full beeeyatch mode. We both ordered off the regular menu. Then, she said it would be 20 minutes and we ordered wine. Before she left, I asked the waitress if she could please ask the chef not to hold the entree until we finished the appetizer... just to put it all in at once. Her response? ""The chef doesn\'t need to be micromanaged like that."" And that, my Yelp friends, was my limit to the abuse I was going to take from this witch of a waitress.\n\nI smiled and said thank you, but we aren\'t going to stay. She said okay, opened the door, walked into the restaurant, and I could hear her behind me exclaiming with a groan as she entered, ""Oh my Gaaaaawwwdd.""\n\nGood thing they\'re in a tourist zone, because Petit Valentien can have a fresh supply of customers the waitress can abuse. As for this local, I\'d recommend one of our other many fine dining establishments and give this one a wide berth, if service is important to you.\n\nTwo last comments: First, we noticed the restaurant had a Help Wanted sign posted, looking for servers, which could hint that maybe the attitude starts at the top and they have a hard time keeping servers. Second, I noticed another one of the local Yelp Elite crew (and other reviewers) also commented on the rude and inattentive service here.

"Chris Copeland of the Indiana Pacers was stabbed after leaving a trendy New York nightclub early Wednesday, and two Atlanta Hawks -- who had just finished a home game hours before the incident -- were among those arrested, according to police and CNN affiliates. The Hawks were not involved in the stabbing incident, police said, but were arrested on obstruction and other charges later. Though New York Police Department Det. Kelly Ort initially told CNN the incident occurred just before 4 a.m. at 1OAK, a club in New York's Chelsea neighborhood known to draw celebrities among its clientele, the club later told CNN that the stabbing occurred in front of the Fulton Houses project down the street. ""1OAK staff was unaware of the incident when it happened, as it occurred beyond their view in a different location. However, 1OAK's team assisted Mr. Copeland to their fullest capabilities, and called for help as soon as he was seen walking back towards the venue,"" the statement said. The statement continued, ""A review of the video footage seems to reveal the incident did not originate from the venue or its immediate surroundings that are under 1OAK supervision."" Copeland and a female companion, Katrine Saltara, were in the club for about 10 minutes before leaving and walking down the street toward Fulton Houses, where their car was parked, said a 1OAK spokesperson. The spokesperson gave CNN additional details on condition of anonymity because 1OAK's legal team had approved only the club's official statement. The suspect, who the spokesperson said never entered 1OAK, stabbed Copeland and Saltara in front of Fulton Houses, and according to the club's statement, ""Mr. Copeland's driver sprang to accost and detain the apparent perpetrator and that individual is now in police custody."" Charges against the suspect are pending, and his name will be released once charges are filed, Ort said. Copeland and Saltara tried to make their way back to the club to seek help from the 20 or so security personnel on hand, leaving a ""bloody trail of handprints"" between the site of the stabbing and the club, the spokesperson said. Copeland ""almost landed right next to the club,"" the spokesperson said, adding that surveillance footage will not show the actual stabbing because it occurred too far away from the club. The club shut down immediately after the incident, the spokesperson said. A male and two females were taken to area hospitals, Ort said. A knife was recovered, a suspect was arrested and two individuals not involved in the dispute -- the Hawks' Pero Antic, 32, and Thabo Sefolosha, 30 -- were arrested on charges of obstructing governmental administration and disorderly conduct, she said. Sefolosha faces an additional charge of resisting arrest, Ort said. Word of the stabbing quickly spread through the club, reaching Antic and Sefolosha, who went outside to check on their friend, Copeland, the 1OAK spokesperson said. At one point, the two began pushing their way through a crowd that had gathered around the scene, leading to their arrests, the spokesperson said. ""We will contest these charges and look forward to communicating the facts of the situation at the appropriate time,"" the players said in a joint statement released by the team. ""We apologize to our respective families, teammates, and the Hawks' organization for any negative attention this incident has brought upon them."" The Hawks are in New York for a Wednesday night game against the Brooklyn Nets. Neither player will be in uniform, the team said. Police released little information Wednesday, but local media identified the injured man as Copeland, 31, who is from Orange, New Jersey. The Pacers released a statement saying Copeland suffered a knife wound to his left elbow and abdomen, and he's in stable condition at a New York hospital. ""We are aware that Chris Copeland was injured early this morning in New York City. We are still gathering information and will update when we know more. Our thoughts are with Chris and those injured,"" Larry Bird, the Pacers' president of basketball operations, said in a statement. Copeland's agent, John Spencer, issued a statement saying, ""We're concerned about the safety of Chris and Katrine. We don't have any details at this particular time. All we can do is pray and wait."" The NBA and the Hawks front office said they were looking into the incident. ""We are aware of the situation involving Pero Antic and Thabo Sefolosha this morning. We are in the process of gathering more information and will have further comment at the appropriate time,"" Hawks spokesman Garin Narain said in an email. Copeland's Pacers are slated to play the New York Knicks on Wednesday night. The pair apparently had only recently arrived in New York prior to their arrests, as both were on the court for the Hawks' 96-69 win over the Phoenix Suns in Atlanta on Tuesday night. Antic played 12 minutes, and Sefolosha played 20. The game ended around 10 p.m. Copeland, a former Knick, was near the nightclub with Saltara when a 22-year-old Brooklyn man approached them, police told CNN affiliate WABC. There was some sort of dispute before the suspect stabbed the 6-foot-8-inch Copeland in the abdomen, slashed Saltara and then slashed another woman, the station reported. Saltara suffered cuts to her arm, breast and buttock, and the other woman suffered a slash to her stomach, CNN affiliate WCBS reported. While WCBS reported that the second woman was 53 years old, WABC reported she was 23. Images published in the New York Daily News showed a considerable amount of blood on the sidewalk and a white sports coupe, roped off with police tape, with several streaks of blood on its driver's side. Antic and Sefolosha interfered with officers trying to establish a crime scene, and one of the Hawks pushed a police officer, WABC reported. The Hawks are preparing for a historic playoff run after clinching the No. 1 seed in the NBA's Eastern Conference. Tuesday's win over the Suns marked a franchise-best 58 wins in a season for the club. The Pacers sit in the conference's 10th spot but are only one game out of playoff contention. CNN's Laura Ly, Jason Durand and Jill Martin contributed to this report.

Solution: Let \(x\) be the distance along the ground from the blimp to the house, as in the picture to the right. Since the ground and the blimp's horizontal line of sight are parallel, we know from elementary geometry that the angle of elevation \(\theta\) from the base of the house to the blimp is equal to the angle of depression from the blimp to the base of the house, i.e. \(\theta = 24^\circ \).

So our next proclamation and last proclamation is the art and wine fair. This is the 35th anniversary of the Alameda Art and Wine Fair. So who's that? I see. Janet Maccabee, executive director of downtown Alameda Business Association. So come on now. Here's your proclamation. Where is the first? Alameda Art and Wine Fair was held 35 years ago on August three and four in 1984. And. Whereas, the event continues to be the largest street festival on the island, staffed by 200 volunteers each year, a total of 7000 volunteers and over 14000 hours of service over the past 35 years. And. Whereas, the event is co-produced by the downtown Alameda Business Association, Daubert, its board of Directors and member businesses and strum productions to raise funds to keep downtown Alameda clean, green and safe. And. Whereas, the event provides an opportunity for thousands of visitors and residents to discover our vibrant downtown districts, celebrate the creativity of Northern California artisans and sample locally crafted beer, wine and food. And. Whereas, more than 200 bands have performed live over the years and a local stage was added in 2018 to highlight Alameda based performers. And. WHEREAS, the event offers family friendly entertainment, including a Ferris wheel, bungee jump, water balls, kiddy train and puppet show. And. Whereas, to celebrate the 35th anniversary Dover will hold, will host a free showing of every poster from the fair's 35 year history collection at the Auto Body Fine Art Gallery on Park Street from July 17 to 28, 2019. So now, therefore, be it resolved that I, Marilyn, as the Ashcroft mayor of the city of Alameda, do hereby proclaim July 27 and 28 as the Art and Wine Fair's 35th anniversary in the city of Alameda and congratulate the downtown Alameda Business Association on their continued success and invite Alameda INS and visitors to enjoy the 2019 Art and Wine Fair. And with that, Ms.. Maccabee, would you like to say a few words?
Speaker 3: Yes, thank you. Madam Mayor, councilmembers and city staff. Thank you for acknowledging that. Acknowledging the 35th anniversary of the art and wine fair in historic downtown Alameda, the downtown Alameda Business Association Board of Directors, Board, committee staff and our event partner Equestrian Productions are most grateful for the years of support that this council and the many that have gone before have given. We are equally thankful for the support of the dedicated city staff, including but not limited to our police and fire departments. Permits and planning, public works, economic development as each have assisted us with the details necessary to pull off this major event. Many of you have volunteered and your time and your talents and you've stood by local residents that have also helped our loyal sponsors and community partners that have helped to fund this undertaking. Share this honor with our association. We'd like to acknowledge our downtown businesses who roll out the welcome mat for tens of thousands of people every time we put this event on. And so we are ever grateful to them for their hospitality. I hope you can all be there on the 27th and 28th. Thank you.

I just wanted to point out that that the impression I got from that incredibly great city comment meeting at the Elks Lodge about carp was so well attended and the ideas were so fantastic. But the one thing I took away was that most people hadn't read the document. They wanted to tell you what they felt about climate and and that sort of thing, but they hadn't read the document, or they may have read the executive summary. And the reason is, is because this document is so heavy. I mean, it's so big. So what I'd like to suggest is that that every time you have a plan, when it's a draft, you make five copies of it, you give it to the library.","Strategies include habitat restoration, chemical and biological control, and commercial harvesting.",0,0,0.00850710365921259

"A brine seep located at the base of East Flower Garden Bank at a depth of about 240 feet . The seep lies within Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary in the Gulf of Mexico. It is formed from super-saline water flowing from under the seafloor. The image was taken by the ROV Argus as part of the Secrets of the Gulf Expedition in March 2007. Credit: Sea Research Foundation and the Ocean Exploration Trust

Salt in the ocean comes from two sources: runoff from the land and openings in the seafloor.

Rocks on land are the major source of salts dissolved in seawater. Rainwater that falls on land is slightly acidic, so it erodes rocks. This releases ions that are carried away to streams and rivers that eventually feed into the ocean. Many of the dissolved ions are used by organisms in the ocean and are removed from the water. Others are not removed, so their concentrations increase over time.

Another source of salts in the ocean is hydrothermal fluids, which come from vents in the seafloor. Ocean water seeps into cracks in the seafloor and is heated by magma from the Earth’s core. The heat causes a series of chemical reactions. The water tends to lose oxygen, magnesium, and sulfates, and pick up metals such as iron, zinc, and copper from surrounding rocks. The heated water is released through vents in the seafloor, carrying the metals with it. Some ocean salts come from underwater volcanic eruptions, which directly release minerals into the ocean.

Salt domes also contribute to the ocean's saltiness. These domes, vast deposits of salt that form over geological timescales, are found underground and undersea around the world. They are common across the continental shelf of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico.

Two of the most prevalent ions in seawater are chloride and sodium. Together, they make up around 85 percent of all dissolved ions in the ocean. Magnesium and sulfate make up another 10 percent of the total. Other ions are found in very small concentrations. The concentration of salt in seawater (salinity) varies with temperature, evaporation, and precipitation. Salinity is generally low at the equator and at the poles, and high at mid-latitudes. The average salinity is about 35 parts per thousand. Stated in another way, about 3.5 percent of the weight of seawater comes from the dissolved salts.","Over time, the process of evaporation and precipitation continuously increases the salt concentration in the ocean .",1,0,0.14728184044361115
"BLITZER: Tonight, House Democrats are accusing President Trump of committing multiple federal crimes, including bribery, even though they were not explicitly referenced in the articles of impeachment. We're joined now by Democratic Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, a member of both the Intelligence and Oversight committees. Congressman, thanks so much for joining us.
REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): Thank you.
BLITZER: And let's walk through what the House of Representatives is about to do. They will take a historic vote to impeach the president on Wednesday. Walk us through what will happen.
KRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, as you know, there are two articles of impeachment, one for abuse of power and the other for obstruction of Congress. And so there will be a vote on these articles. Obviously, I don't think that the speaker is doing anything other than directing people to vote per their conscience and their constituents. And I think that's what people are going to do on Wednesday.
BLITZER: Your Republican colleague Will Hurd of Texas says, you can vote against impeachment, but still disagree with some of the president's behavior. How do you respond to that?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I respectfully disagree with my colleague, in the sense that this type of behavior is precisely why the framers of the Constitution incorporated an impeachment provision within the Constitution. The framers were deeply concerned about foreign powers getting involved in the domestic affairs of America. And, specifically, they would have been extremely concerned about pressuring a foreign power or getting a foreign power to get involved in our elections. In this particular case, that's exactly what the evidence shows that the president, over a pattern of -- over several months exhibited a pattern of conduct in which he pressured the Ukrainians to basically investigate his political rivals, thereby compromising national security and the integrity of our elections, Wolf.
BLITZER: What does it say to you, Congressman, that not a single Republican in the House is expected to vote for either of these articles of impeachment?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, as you know, Justin Amash, I guess, was a Republican before he disagreed with the president. I think that he will probably vote in favor of the articles. That being said, at this point, I think everyone has to vote their conscience and has to do the right thing and put the Constitution above party and politics. That's extremely important.
BLITZER: Should Justin Amash, who is now an independent member of the House, serve as an impeachment case manager, a manager in the course of the trial in the Senate, as some of your Democratic colleagues are recommending?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't want to speculate on who the manager is going to be. I know that Nancy Pelosi is going to assemble a team that knows the facts and brings credit to the House in presenting the case in the Senate.
BLITZER: In an interview, a new interview, as we have been reporting, in “The New Yorker“ magazine, Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, made this admission about his campaign to push out the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. He says this. He says: “I believed that I needed Yovanovitch out of the way. She was going to make the investigations difficult for everybody.“ So, what do you think? How significant is that admission by Giuliani?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I think it's very significant. And that's what the evidence showed during the hearings, that Rudy Giuliani and the president basically pushed Ambassador Yovanovitch away to basically install Rudy Giuliani in charge of Ukraine policy, along with the three amigos, Ambassador Sondland, Rick Perry and Volker, Ambassador Volker. And, basically, what they sought to do was to basically commandeer Ukraine policy in favor of Donald Trump's political ambitions. And, as I said before, that's a shadow foreign policy. That is not necessarily in the best interests of the country, but maybe in the best interest of Rudy Giuliani's clients and Donald Trump's political agenda. But that's not the way that our foreign policy should ever be run.
BLITZER: Should Giuliani be called as a witness?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't know. We have never received the documents that were subpoenaed from Giuliani. I personally -- I'm speaking for myself. I personally believe that we should always view documents from a witness before they are examined in terms of their live testimony. And so I'd like to see those documents first.
BLITZER: Congressman Krishnamoorthi, thanks so much for joining us.
KRISHNAMOORTHI: Thank you so much.
BLITZER: All right, just ahead, we're going to have much more on Rudy Giuliani unplugged when it comes to Ukraine. Why is he apparently admitting he wanted the former U.S. ambassador ousted, so he could freely dig up dirt for the -- on the Bidens? Plus, after two crashes, why is Boeing now halting, halting production of the 737 MAX?",Shadow foreign policy refers to actions taken by private individuals or groups outside of official government channels to influence foreign policy in favor of their own interests.,1,0,0.017181433737277985

WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Thanks very much, Lou. Poker, hookers and the CIA? Police search the home of the man who was the third in charge over at the Central Intelligence Agency. It's a very complicated story, but we are going to sort it out for you tonight. Also, President Bush's immigration plan, he's planning, as you know, a prime time address on Monday night. We'll take a closer look at what he's expected to say. And Saddam Hussein's new book. That's right. On the eve of the U.S.-led invasion he was supposedly finishing his novel. We have the story. And Bush versus Clinton, how does the current president stack up against the previous one? We hit the streets to find out. We've got some new poll numbers on that. Lots more coming up, Lou, at the top of the hour.
DOBBS: Looking forward to it. Thank you, Wolf. An update tonight on the story we reported here last night. A judge in California issuing a temporary injunction tonight against California's new high school exit exam. Thousands of students failed the test even though they were tested only on eighth grade math comprehension, ninth and 10th grade level English. California sued by students, 10 of them, who failed the exam. Today's ruling could potentially allow thousands of students who didn't pass that test to graduate. Turning now to the war in Iraq, four of our Marines have been killed in an accident in Al Anbar Province west of Baghdad. The Marines were crewmen in a M-1 Abrams tank. The tank rolled off a bridge and fell into a canal. Two thousand four hundred and thirty four of our troops have now died in Iraq since the war began three years ago. “Heroes“ now, our weekly tribute to the brave men and women who serve this nation around the world. Tonight we go to Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and meet Marines who bravely gave for their country on the battlefield and now give to one another after the battle. Barbara Starr has the story.
BARBARA STARR, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is morning formation for wounded Marines at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. They sit because some cannot stand. Glenn Minney struggles with a Mother's Day card. A mortar damaged his eyes, but this medic is still the doc.
PETTY OFF. GLENN MINNEY, U.S. NAVY CORPSMAN: That's my job. I'm going continue to do it as long as I can, blind or not.
STARR: In this remarkable place, Marines help each other just as on the battlefield.
GUNNERY SGT. KEN BARNES, U.S. MARINE CORPS: I have a leg injury and I can't get my room vacuumed. One of the guys will be hey, I got no problem, I've got you. You're still required with a leg injury to keep your clothes picked up and all your trash picked up.
STARR: An IED left Gunnery Sergeant Ken Barnes with nerve damage. He knows Marines don't want to need help.
BARNES: That's one of the things that's really nice about this place is you can say, hey, can you give me a hand? And they are immediately on. There are four or five guys that will be standing there waiting to help, but you've got to ask for it.
STARR: Sergeant Karl Klepper's ankle was crushed by a roadside blast.
SGT. KARL KLEPPER, U.S. MARINE CORPS: We're all broken up. We're all beaten up here, but we're not broken, our spirits aren't broken.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He helps me at math. We call him Sergeant
K. STARR: As part of their rehab, Klepper and others help at the base school. (on-camera): The Marines here today and these children have an unshakable bond, perhaps only they can understand. Many of these young students now have parents serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.
BRANDON, 1ST GRADER: The Marines help us think about what we can write about and what we can help, so we can do good at math and writing.
STARR (voice-over): Lieutenant Colonel Tim Maxwell has a brain injury from a mortar attack. He started the barracks so Marines could recover together.
LT. COL. TIM MAXWELL, U.S. MARINE CORPS: They come here, stay for just a couple of days and see other Marines are wounded and how far they are in life. Instead of going home with their mom and dad and wondering, I wonder what it means to get shot in the leg. I don't know what that means in three months. Here, he'll see.

"[1] One theory is that the rings formed at the same time as the planet and its major moons. In this case, if material is close to the planet, the planet’s gravitational pull is too strong to coalesce into a moon and the particles that would otherwise form a moon spread out in orbit around the planet as a ring.Another idea is that a close call by a moon or comet results in the planet’s gravitational tidal force breaking up those bodies, the debris of which then becomes a ring system.

[2] The answer seems to be that there are small moons orbiting ringed planets at or near the distance from the planets as the rings themselves, and that these moons are needed to keep the rings from flying apart. So, basically, having enough moons the right distance from the planet makes rings possible.

[3] At present, scientists aren’t entirely sure how these ring systems came about. They may have formed from leftover material from the formation of the planet, or be the remains of a moon that was destroyed by an impact or simply broken apart by the gravitational force of the parent planet.

[4] Scientists are also unsure why only the gas giants have rings. They think it may be related to the same process that resulted in gas giants forming only in the outer Solar System while rocky planets formed only in the inner Solar System. It is thought that the energy given off by the infant Sun expelled most of the light gases and other volatile molecules from the inner regions of the Solar System, leaving heavier elements able to form inner rocky planets. This process also seems to have made it easier for the outer planets to form moons.
So, the combination of large gravitational forces, the existence of volatile materials such as ices and the shepherding of material by numerous moons probably mean the outer planets were far more likely to form and keep planetary rings.",The energy from the early Sun caused light gases and volatile materials to be expelled from the inner parts of the Solar System.,1,1,0.9833611845970154
"Shay Given has revealed the pain still lingers from Ruud Gullit’s decision to snub him for the 1999 FA Cup final between Newcastle and Manchester United. The Republic of Ireland goalkeeper played every round of Newcastle’s run but was dropped in favour of Steve Harper for the Wembley showpiece, won 2-0 by Sir Alex Ferguson’s side. Given has yet to experience a truly fulfilling visit to the national stadium. He played in the 1998 FA Cup final loss to Arsenal, as well as the semi-final defeat to Chelsea in 2000. Shay Given will start for Aston Villa against Liverpool in Sunday's FA Cup semi-final at Wembley . He has an FA Cup winners’ medal from 2011 but was an unusued substitute for the final against Stoke with Joe Hart in net. He is out to make amends against Liverpool. ‘It was nice to be part of winning it with Man City but when you don’t play it doesn’t have the same value,’ he said. ‘I don’t know where my medal is to be honest. ‘1999 was a bit of a slap in the face. Do you ever get over it, I suppose? It’s not an easy one. Ruud Gullit didn’t even tell me, he got the goalkeeping coach Terry Gennoe to tell me I wasn’t playing. ‘But you can’t look back in football, you’ve just got to look forward. I’d love to win a trophy and make a bit of history at Aston Villa.’. The 38-year-old has played in all four of Villa's FA Cup matches this season and has kept two clean-sheets. Villa manager Tim Sherwood confirmed Given will start on Sunday, a day before the Irishman turns 39. Manager Tim Sherwood has confirmed Given, who turns 39 tomorrow, will keep his Cup place rather than be replaced by No 1 Brad Guzan. Given has played every round of the competition, beginning under Paul Lambert, and make key saves along the way. . Given admitted he felt matches of this magnitude had passed him by when he was out on loan at Middlesbrough last season, as Lambert jettisoned players he needed to remove off the wage bill. Last April, he was in the dugout assisting Villa’s former manager as coach when Ian Culverhouse and Gary Karsa were suspended. ‘I am employed by Aston Villa and I felt I could help out,’ said Given. ‘Life is too short to have grudges.’. Sherwood watched his Villa side in training as they prepare for the Sunday's crunch clash. Sherwood, his former Blackburn teammate, has provided a ‘new lease of life’. . ‘Tim is a very ambitious guy, he wants to keep the club in the Premier League and win the FA Cup. There have been occasions this season where people have seen the angry side. But ten minutes later he is putting his arm around the same player. One of his best skills is man management. He knows how to get the best out of people.’. Given has regained his place in the Ireland team and is wants to play at Euro 2016 should his country qualify. He would also like to take the goalkeeping shirt off Brad Guzan in the Premier League. He has a year left on his contract this summer and will discuss his prospects with Sherwood. ‘This run has shown I’m still capable and hopefully it gives a seed of doubt into the manager’s head as well that if he wants to mix it up in the Premier League.’ . Aston Villa defeated rivals West Brom 2-0 in the last round to book their semi-final appearance at Wembley.  .",Shay Given will start for Aston Villa against Liverpool in Sunday's FA Cup semi - final at Wembley.

We weren\'t in a huge rush, but we didn\'t have hours to dine, because I had dough proofing at home and needed to attend to it. Hubby walked in and checked in with waitress and came out saying we should take any seat we wanted and she\'d be right out with menus. So, we sat next to the Xmas tree on the patio and waited... and waited... and waited.\n\nWe figured she couldn\'t see us so we moved right next to the front door, where she couldn\'t miss us. After waiting several minutes, I decided we would wait 5 more minutes and then find somewhere else for dinner. After 3 minutes, a 30-something brunette waitress came and dropped off menus. I let her know the table was wobbly and she said she\'d bring a block for it (which she never did). Oddly, I detected a twinge of attitude from the waitress with that exchange... not sure why, but there was an element of nastiness in her tone. She also turned on the table-side heater, which was very effective, if somewhat atmosphere-killing, because of its very bright coils.\n\nI pulled up Yelp to look at the pics of the entrees and we settled on what we wanted to order. After about 5 more minutes, the waitress returned and informed us that dinner would take longer here than other restaurants. I let her know I was proofing dough at home and if we ordered immediately, how long would it take. She replied that if we ordered faster, the food would come faster. (Duh! Crazy how that works!) Again, a twinge of nastiness.\n\nHubby and I heard the specials and I asked her to repeat the sides on one of the specials. Attitude was ramping up from her. I asked her what her favorite item on the menu was and she replied, ""I can\'t say. You\'re the one who\'s going to eat it, not me! The chef wouldn\'t even tell you."" \n\nI didn\'t dare ask another question, because she was in full beeeyatch mode. We both ordered off the regular menu. Then, she said it would be 20 minutes and we ordered wine. Before she left, I asked the waitress if she could please ask the chef not to hold the entree until we finished the appetizer... just to put it all in at once. Her response? ""The chef doesn\'t need to be micromanaged like that."" And that, my Yelp friends, was my limit to the abuse I was going to take from this witch of a waitress.\n\nI smiled and said thank you, but we aren\'t going to stay. She said okay, opened the door, walked into the restaurant, and I could hear her behind me exclaiming with a groan as she entered, ""Oh my Gaaaaawwwdd.""\n\nGood thing they\'re in a tourist zone, because Petit Valentien can have a fresh supply of customers the waitress can abuse. As for this local, I\'d recommend one of our other many fine dining establishments and give this one a wide berth, if service is important to you.\n\nTwo last comments: First, we noticed the restaurant had a Help Wanted sign posted, looking for servers, which could hint that maybe the attitude starts at the top and they have a hard time keeping servers. Second, I noticed another one of the local Yelp Elite crew (and other reviewers) also commented on the rude and inattentive service here.

"[1] It actually derives from monitor manufacturers. If the monitor cable is screwed in and you accidentally get it caught and tug on it, the monitor crashes to the floor and you have to buy a new one. They've made millions on this.

[2] Of course it's not a huge deal if the cable falls out of the computer, which is also why you don't have to use the screws if you don't want to. However, it's usually safer to use them to prevent accidental disconnection (saves you the headache of checking behind your computer every time your monitor blanks out), and indeed, a typical VGA/DVI connector lacks the physical holding pressure a standard USB connector does.

[3] This is just an effect of the design, nothing more, nothing less. These cables weren't designed for quick/fast insertion and removal, since it's unlikely to be used quite as much as, for example, a USB port.

[4] It is estimated that consumers who often plug in HDMI HD cable will think more or less to make HDMI fixed like VGA. HDMI interface is too shallow, it always feels unstable, and the connector interface will be loose if plug in too often. But there are many reasons why the HDMI HD cable does not come with screws universally:
1、If the HDMI is attached with a screw, it is likely to cause a lot of problems with the format of the screw and the screw hole diameter. After all, the selection and process of each manufacturer are inconsistent.
2、Equipment manufacturers should reserve the screw position, screw thread diameter and other issues, need to increase the cost of communication with the manufacturer, and is not suitable for the trend of precision equipment in the new era.
3、At the beginning of the design, designer wanted to support the hot plugging of the HDMI high-definition cable. If it is fixed, it will become unworthy. Although there seems to be a lot of hot-plugging burning the interfaces problems.","HDMI and other cables, like USB or DisplayPort, use a different type of connector that doesn’t require screws.",0,0,0.03368162363767624

A judge in California issuing a temporary injunction tonight against California's new high school exit exam. Thousands of students failed the test even though they were tested only on eighth grade math comprehension, ninth and 10th grade level English. California sued by students, 10 of them, who failed the exam. Today's ruling could potentially allow thousands of students who didn't pass that test to graduate.

"As goes Walmart, so goes the nation? Everyone from Apple CEO Tim Cook to the head of the NCAA slammed religious freedom laws being considered in several states this week, warning that they would open the door to discrimination against gay and lesbian customers. But it was the opposition from Walmart, the ubiquitous retailer that dots the American landscape, that perhaps resonated most deeply, providing the latest evidence of growing support for gay rights in the heartland. Walmart's staunch criticism of a religious freedom law in its home state of Arkansas came after the company said in February it would boost pay for about 500,000 workers well above the federal minimum wage. Taken together, the company is emerging as a bellwether for shifting public opinion on hot-button political issues that divide conservatives and liberals. And some prominent Republicans are urging the party to take notice. Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who famously called on the GOP to ""be the party of Sam's Club, not just the country club,"" told CNN that Walmart's actions ""foreshadow where the Republican Party will need to move."" ""The Republican Party will have to better stand for"" ideas on helping the middle class, said Pawlenty, the head of the Financial Services Roundtable, a Washington lobbying group for the finance industry. The party's leaders must be ""willing to put forward ideas that will help modest income workers, such as a reasonable increase in the minimum wage, and prohibit discrimination in things such as jobs, housing, public accommodation against gays and lesbians."" Walmart, which employs more than 50,000 people in Arkansas, emerged victorious on Wednesday. Hours after the company's CEO, Doug McMillon, called on Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson to veto the bill, the governor held a news conference and announced he would not sign the legislation unless its language was fixed. Walmart's opposition to the religious freedom law once again puts the company at odds with many in the Republican Party, which the company's political action committee has tended to support. In 2004, the Walmart PAC gave around $2 million to Republicans versus less than $500,000 to Democrats, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. That gap has grown less pronounced in recent years. In 2014, the PAC spent about $1.3 million to support Republicans and around $970,000 for Democrats. It has been a gradual transformation for Walmart. In 2011, the company bulked up its nondiscrimination policies by adding protections for gender identity. Two years later, the company announced that it would start offering health insurance benefits to same-sex partners of employees starting in 2014. Retail experts say Walmart's evolution on these issues over the years is partly a reflection of its diverse consumer base, as well as a recognition of the country's increasingly progressive views of gay equality (support for same-sex marriage is at a new high of 59%, according to a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll). ""It's easy for someone like a Chick-fil-A to take a really polarizing position,"" said Dwight Hill, a partner at the retail consulting firm McMillanDoolittle. ""But in the world of the largest retailer in the world, that's very different."" Hill added: Same-sex marriage, ""while divisive, it's becoming more common place here within the U.S., and the businesses by definition have to follow the trend of their customer."" The backlash over the religious freedom measures in Indiana and Arkansas this week is shining a bright light on the broader business community's overwhelming support for workplace policies that promote gay equality. After Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a Republican, signed his state's religious freedom bill into law, CEOs of companies big and small across the country threatened to pull out of the Hoosier state. The resistance came from business leaders of all political persuasions, including Bill Oesterle, CEO of the business-rating website Angie's List and a one-time campaign manager for former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels. Oesterle announced that his company would put plans on hold to expand its footprint in Indianapolis in light of the state's passage of the religious freedom act. NASCAR, scheduled to hold a race in Indianapolis this summer, also spoke out against the Indiana law. ""What we're seeing over the past week is a tremendous amount of support from the business community who are standing up and are sending that equality is good for business and discrimination is bad for business,"" said Jason Rahlan, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign. The debate has reached presidential politics. National Republicans are being forced to walk the fine line of protecting religious liberties and supporting nondiscrimination. Likely GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush initially backed Indiana's religious freedom law and Pence, but moderated his tone a few days later. The former Florida governor said Wednesday that Indiana could have taken a ""better"" and ""more consensus-oriented approach."" ""By the end of the week, Indiana will be in the right place,"" Bush said, a reference to Pence's promise this week to fix his state's law in light of the widespread backlash. Others in the GOP field are digging in. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the only officially declared Republican presidential candidate, said Wednesday that he had no interest in second-guessing Pence and lashed out at the business community for opposing the law. ""I think it is unfortunate that large companies today are listening to the extreme left wing agenda that is driven by an aggressive gay marriage agenda,"" Cruz said. Meanwhile, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who previously served on Walmart's board of directors, called on Hutchinson to veto the Arkansas bill, saying it would ""permit unfair discrimination"" against the LGBT community. Jay Chesshir, CEO of the Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce in Arkansas, welcomed Hutchinson's pledge on Wednesday to seek changes to his state's bill. He said businesses are not afraid to wade into a politically controversial debate to ensure inclusive workplace policies. ""When it comes to culture and quality of life, businesses are extremely interested in engaging in debate simply because it impacts its more precious resource -- and that's its people,"" Chesshir said. ""Therefore, when issues arise that have negative or positive impact on those things, then the business community will again speak and speak loudly.""

"By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. The United States faces persistent and increasingly sophisticated malicious cyber campaigns that threaten the public sector, the private sector, and ultimately the American people’s security and privacy. The Federal Government must improve its efforts to identify, deter, protect against, detect, and respond to these actions and actors. The Federal Government must also carefully examine what occurred during any major cyber incident and apply lessons learned. But cybersecurity requires more than government action. Protecting our Nation from malicious cyber actors requires the Federal Government to partner with the private sector. The private sector must adapt to the continuously changing threat environment, ensure its products are built and operate securely, and partner with the Federal Government to foster a more secure cyberspace. In the end, the trust we place in our digital infrastructure should be proportional to how trustworthy and transparent that infrastructure is, and to the consequences we will incur if that trust is misplaced.
Incremental improvements will not give us the security we need; instead, the Federal Government needs to make bold changes and significant investments in order to defend the vital institutions that underpin the American way of life. The Federal Government must bring to bear the full scope of its authorities and resources to protect and secure its computer systems, whether they are cloud-based, on-premises, or hybrid. The scope of protection and security must include systems that process data (information technology (IT)) and those that run the vital machinery that ensures our safety (operational technology (OT)).
It is the policy of my Administration that the prevention, detection, assessment, and remediation of cyber incidents is a top priority and essential to national and economic security. The Federal Government must lead by example. All Federal Information Systems should meet or exceed the standards and requirements for cybersecurity set forth in and issued pursuant to this order.
Sec. 2. Removing Barriers to Sharing Threat Information.
(a) The Federal Government contracts with IT and OT service providers to conduct an array of day-to-day functions on Federal Information Systems. These service providers, including cloud service providers, have unique access to and insight into cyber threat and incident information on Federal Information Systems. At the same time, current contract terms or restrictions may limit the sharing of such threat or incident information with executive departments and agencies (agencies) that are responsible for investigating or remediating cyber incidents, such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and other elements of the Intelligence Community (IC). Removing these contractual barriers and increasing the sharing of information about such threats, incidents, and risks are necessary steps to accelerating incident deterrence, prevention, and response efforts and to enabling more effective defense of agencies’ systems and of information collected, processed, and maintained by or for the Federal Government.
(b) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence, shall review the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement contract requirements and language for contracting with IT and OT service providers and recommend updates to such requirements and language to the FAR Council and other appropriate agencies. The recommendations shall include descriptions of contractors to be covered by the proposed contract language.
(c) The recommended contract language and requirements described in subsection (b) of this section shall be designed to ensure that:
(i) service providers collect and preserve data, information, and reporting relevant to cybersecurity event prevention, detection, response, and investigation on all information systems over which they have control, including systems operated on behalf of agencies, consistent with agencies’ requirements;
(ii) service providers share such data, information, and reporting, as they relate to cyber incidents or potential incidents relevant to any agency with which they have contracted, directly with such agency and any other agency that the Director of OMB, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence, deems appropriate, consistent with applicable privacy laws, regulations, and policies;
(iii) service providers collaborate with Federal cybersecurity or investigative agencies in their investigations of and responses to incidents or potential incidents on Federal Information Systems, including by implementing technical capabilities, such as monitoring networks for threats in collaboration with agencies they support, as needed; and
(iv) service providers share cyber threat and incident information with agencies, doing so, where possible, in industry-recognized formats for incident response and remediation.
(d) Within 90 days of receipt of the recommendations described in subsection (b) of this section, the FAR Council shall review the proposed contract language and conditions and, as appropriate, shall publish for public comment proposed updates to the FAR.
(e) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of OMB shall take appropriate steps to ensure to the greatest extent possible that service providers share data with agencies, CISA, and the FBI as may be necessary for the Federal Government to respond to cyber threats, incidents, and risks.
(f) It is the policy of the Federal Government that:
(i) information and communications technology (ICT) service providers entering into contracts with agencies must promptly report to such agencies when they discover a cyber incident involving a software product or service provided to such agencies or involving a support system for a software product or service provided to such agencies;
(ii) ICT service providers must also directly report to CISA whenever they report under subsection (f)(i) of this section to Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) Agencies, and CISA must centrally collect and manage such information; and
(iii) reports pertaining to National Security Systems, as defined in section 10(h) of this order, must be received and managed by the appropriate agency as to be determined under subsection (g)(i)(E) of this section.
(g) To implement the policy set forth in subsection (f) of this section:
(i) Within 45 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense acting through the Director of the National Security Agency (NSA), the Attorney General, and the Director of OMB, shall recommend to the FAR Council contract language that identifies:
(A) the nature of cyber incidents that require reporting;
(B) the types of information regarding cyber incidents that require reporting to facilitate effective cyber incident response and remediation;
(C) appropriate and effective protections for privacy and civil liberties;
(D) the time periods within which contractors must report cyber incidents based on a graduated scale of severity, with reporting on the most severe cyber incidents not to exceed 3 days after initial detection;
(E) National Security Systems reporting requirements; and
(F) the type of contractors and associated service providers to be covered by the proposed contract language.
(ii) Within 90 days of receipt of the recommendations described in subsection (g)(i) of this section, the FAR Council shall review the recommendations and publish for public comment proposed updates to the FAR.
(iii) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense acting through the Director of the NSA, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence shall jointly develop procedures for ensuring that cyber incident reports are promptly and appropriately shared among agencies.
(h) Current cybersecurity requirements for unclassified system contracts are largely implemented through agency-specific policies and regulations, including cloud-service cybersecurity requirements. Standardizing common cybersecurity contractual requirements across agencies will streamline and improve compliance for vendors and the Federal Government.
(i) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security acting through the Director of CISA, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense acting through the Director of the NSA, the Director of OMB, and the Administrator of General Services, shall review agency-specific cybersecurity requirements that currently exist as a matter of law, policy, or contract and recommend to the FAR Council standardized contract language for appropriate cybersecurity requirements. Such recommendations shall include consideration of the scope of contractors and associated service providers to be covered by the proposed contract language.
(j) Within 60 days of receiving the recommended contract language developed pursuant to subsection (i) of this section, the FAR Council shall review the recommended contract language and publish for public comment proposed updates to the FAR.
(k) Following any updates to the FAR made by the FAR Council after the public comment period described in subsection (j) of this section, agencies shall update their agency-specific cybersecurity requirements to remove any requirements that are duplicative of such FAR updates.
(l) The Director of OMB shall incorporate into the annual budget process a cost analysis of all recommendations developed under this section.
Sec. 3. Modernizing Federal Government Cybersecurity.
(a) To keep pace with today’s dynamic and increasingly sophisticated cyber threat environment, the Federal Government must take decisive steps to modernize its approach to cybersecurity, including by increasing the Federal Government’s visibility into threats, while protecting privacy and civil liberties. The Federal Government must adopt security best practices; advance toward Zero Trust Architecture; accelerate movement to secure cloud services, including Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and Platform as a Service (PaaS); centralize and streamline access to cybersecurity data to drive analytics for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks; and invest in both technology and personnel to match these modernization goals.
(b) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall:
(i) update existing agency plans to prioritize resources for the adoption and use of cloud technology as outlined in relevant OMB guidance;
(ii) develop a plan to implement Zero Trust Architecture, which shall incorporate, as appropriate, the migration steps that the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) within the Department of Commerce has outlined in standards and guidance, describe any such steps that have already been completed, identify activities that will have the most immediate security impact, and include a schedule to implement them; and
(iii) provide a report to the Director of OMB and the Assistant to the President and National Security Advisor (APNSA) discussing the plans required pursuant to subsection (b)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(c) As agencies continue to use cloud technology, they shall do so in a coordinated, deliberate way that allows the Federal Government to prevent, detect, assess, and remediate cyber incidents. To facilitate this approach, the migration to cloud technology shall adopt Zero Trust Architecture, as practicable. The CISA shall modernize its current cybersecurity programs, services, and capabilities to be fully functional with cloud-computing environments with Zero Trust Architecture. The Secretary of Homeland Security acting through the Director of CISA, in consultation with the Administrator of General Services acting through the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) within the General Services Administration, shall develop security principles governing Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) for incorporation into agency modernization efforts. To facilitate this work:
(i) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Director of OMB, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security acting through the Director of CISA, and the Administrator of General Services acting through FedRAMP, shall develop a Federal cloud-security strategy and provide guidance to agencies accordingly. Such guidance shall seek to ensure that risks to the FCEB from using cloud-based services are broadly understood and effectively addressed, and that FCEB Agencies move closer to Zero Trust Architecture.
(ii) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security acting through the Director of CISA, in consultation with the Director of OMB and the Administrator of General Services acting through FedRAMP, shall develop and issue, for the FCEB, cloud-security technical reference architecture documentation that illustrates recommended approaches to cloud migration and data protection for agency data collection and reporting.

Sec. 4. Enhancing Software Supply Chain Security.
(a) The security of software used by the Federal Government is vital to the Federal Government’s ability to perform its critical functions. The development of commercial software often lacks transparency, sufficient focus on the ability of the software to resist attack, and adequate controls to prevent tampering by malicious actors. There is a pressing need to implement more rigorous and predictable mechanisms for ensuring that products function securely, and as intended. The security and integrity of “critical software” — software that performs functions critical to trust (such as affording or requiring elevated system privileges or direct access to networking and computing resources) — is a particular concern. Accordingly, the Federal Government must take action to rapidly improve the security and integrity of the software supply chain, with a priority on addressing critical software.
(b) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce acting through the Director of NIST shall solicit input from the Federal Government, private sector, academia, and other appropriate actors to identify existing or develop new standards, tools, and best practices for complying with the standards, procedures, or criteria in subsection (e) of this section. The guidelines shall include criteria that can be used to evaluate software security, include criteria to evaluate the security practices of the developers and suppliers themselves, and identify innovative tools or methods to demonstrate conformance with secure practices.

Sec. 6. Standardizing the Federal Government’s Playbook for Responding to Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities and Incidents.
(a) The cybersecurity vulnerability and incident response procedures currently used to identify, remediate, and recover from vulnerabilities and incidents affecting their systems vary across agencies, hindering the ability of lead agencies to analyze vulnerabilities and incidents more comprehensively across agencies. Standardized response processes ensure a more coordinated and centralized cataloging of incidents and tracking of agencies’ progress toward successful responses.
(b) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security acting through the Director of CISA, in consultation with the Director of OMB, the Federal Chief Information Officers Council, and the Federal Chief Information Security Council, and in coordination with the Secretary of Defense acting through the Director of the NSA, the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence, shall develop a standard set of operational procedures (playbook) to be used in planning and conducting a cybersecurity vulnerability and incident response activity respecting FCEB Information Systems. The playbook shall:
(i) incorporate all appropriate NIST standards;
(ii) be used by FCEB Agencies; and
(iii) articulate progress and completion through all phases of an incident response, while allowing flexibility so it may be used in support of various response activities.
(c) The Director of OMB shall issue guidance on agency use of the playbook.
(d) Agencies with cybersecurity vulnerability or incident response procedures that deviate from the playbook may use such procedures only after consulting with the Director of OMB and the APNSA and demonstrating that these procedures meet or exceed the standards proposed in the playbook.
(e) The Director of CISA, in consultation with the Director of the NSA, shall review and update the playbook annually, and provide information to the Director of OMB for incorporation in guidance updates.
(f) To ensure comprehensiveness of incident response activities and build confidence that unauthorized cyber actors no longer have access to FCEB Information Systems, the playbook shall establish, consistent with applicable law, a requirement that the Director of CISA review and validate FCEB Agencies’ incident response and remediation results upon an agency’s completion of its incident response. The Director of CISA may recommend use of another agency or a third-party incident response team as appropriate.
(g) To ensure a common understanding of cyber incidents and the cybersecurity status of an agency, the playbook shall define key terms and use such terms consistently with any statutory definitions of those terms, to the extent practicable, thereby providing a shared lexicon among agencies using the playbook.
Sec. 7. Improving Detection of Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities and Incidents on Federal Government Networks.
(a) The Federal Government shall employ all appropriate resources and authorities to maximize the early detection of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and incidents on its networks. This approach shall include increasing the Federal Government’s visibility into and detection of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats to agency networks in order to bolster the Federal Government’s cybersecurity efforts.
(b) FCEB Agencies shall deploy an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) initiative to support proactive detection of cybersecurity incidents within Federal Government infrastructure, active cyber hunting, containment and remediation, and incident response.
(c) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security acting through the Director of CISA shall provide to the Director of OMB recommendations on options for implementing an EDR initiative, centrally located to support host-level visibility, attribution, and response regarding FCEB Information Systems.
(d) Within 90 days of receiving the recommendations described in subsection (c) of this section, the Director of OMB, in consultation with Secretary of Homeland Security, shall issue requirements for FCEB Agencies to adopt Federal Government-wide EDR approaches. Those requirements shall support a capability of the Secretary of Homeland Secretary, acting through the Director of CISA, to engage in cyber hunt, detection, and response activities.
(e) The Director of OMB shall work with the Secretary of Homeland Security and agency heads to ensure that agencies have adequate resources to comply with the requirements issued pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.
(f) Defending FCEB Information Systems requires that the Secretary of Homeland Security acting through the Director of CISA have access to agency data that are relevant to a threat and vulnerability analysis, as well as for assessment and threat-hunting purposes. Within 75 days of the date of this order, agencies shall establish or update Memoranda of Agreement (MOA) with CISA for the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation Program to ensure object level data, as defined in the MOA, are available and accessible to CISA, consistent with applicable law.
(g) Within 45 days of the date of this order, the Director of the NSA as the National Manager for National Security Systems (National Manager) shall recommend to the Secretary of Defense, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) appropriate actions for improving detection of cyber incidents affecting National Security Systems, to the extent permitted by applicable law, including recommendations concerning EDR approaches and whether such measures should be operated by agencies or through a centralized service of common concern provided by the National Manager.
(h) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense, the Director of National Intelligence, and the CNSS shall review the recommendations submitted under subsection (g) of this section and, as appropriate, establish policies that effectuate those recommendations, consistent with applicable law.
(i) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Director of CISA shall provide to the Director of OMB and the APNSA a report describing how authorities granted under section 1705 of Public Law 116-283, to conduct threat-hunting activities on FCEB networks without prior authorization from agencies, are being implemented. This report shall also recommend procedures to ensure that mission-critical systems are not disrupted, procedures for notifying system owners of vulnerable government systems, and the range of techniques that can be used during testing of FCEB Information Systems. The Director of CISA shall provide quarterly reports to the APNSA and the Director of OMB regarding actions taken under section 1705 of Public Law 116-283.

Sec. 8. Improving the Federal Government’s Investigative and Remediation Capabilities.
(a) Information from network and system logs on Federal Information Systems (for both on-premises systems and connections hosted by third parties, such as CSPs) is invaluable for both investigation and remediation purposes. It is essential that agencies and their IT service providers collect and maintain such data and, when necessary to address a cyber incident on FCEB Information Systems, provide them upon request to the Secretary of Homeland Security through the Director of CISA and to the FBI, consistent with applicable law.
(b) Within 14 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Administrator of the Office of Electronic Government within OMB, shall provide to the Director of OMB recommendations on requirements for logging events and retaining other relevant data within an agency’s systems and networks. Such recommendations shall include the types of logs to be maintained, the time periods to retain the logs and other relevant data, the time periods for agencies to enable recommended logging and security requirements, and how to protect logs. Logs shall be protected by cryptographic methods to ensure integrity once collected and periodically verified against the hashes throughout their retention. Data shall be retained in a manner consistent with all applicable privacy laws and regulations. Such recommendations shall also be considered by the FAR Council when promulgating rules pursuant to section 2 of this order.
(c) Within 90 days of receiving the recommendations described in subsection (b) of this section, the Director of OMB, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall formulate policies for agencies to establish requirements for logging, log retention, and log management, which shall ensure centralized access and visibility for the highest level security operations center of each agency.
(d) The Director of OMB shall work with agency heads to ensure that agencies have adequate resources to comply with the requirements identified in subsection (c) of this section.

These requirements should be designed to permit agencies to share log information, as needed and appropriate, with other Federal agencies for cyber risks or incidents.
Sec. 9. National Security Systems.
(a) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense acting through the National Manager, in coordination with the Director of National Intelligence and the CNSS, and in consultation with the APNSA, shall adopt National Security Systems requirements that are equivalent to or exceed the cybersecurity requirements set forth in this order that are otherwise not applicable to National Security Systems. Such requirements may provide for exceptions in circumstances necessitated by unique mission needs. Such requirements shall be codified in a National Security Memorandum (NSM). Until such time as that NSM is issued, programs, standards, or requirements established pursuant to this order shall not apply with respect to National Security Systems.
(b) Nothing in this order shall alter the authority of the National Manager with respect to National Security Systems as defined in National Security Directive 42 of July 5, 1990 (National Policy for the Security of National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems) (NSD-42). The FCEB network shall continue to be within the authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security acting through the Director of CISA.
Sec. 10. Definitions. For purposes of this order:
(a) the term “agency” has the meaning ascribed to it under 44 U.S.C. 3502.
(b) the term “auditing trust relationship” means an agreed-upon relationship between two or more system elements that is governed by criteria for secure interaction, behavior, and outcomes relative to the protection of assets.
(c) the term “cyber incident” has the meaning ascribed to an “incident” under 44 U.S.C. 3552(b)(2).
(d) the term “Federal Civilian Executive Branch Agencies” or “FCEB Agencies” includes all agencies except for the Department of Defense and agencies in the Intelligence Community.
(e) the term “Federal Civilian Executive Branch Information Systems” or “FCEB Information Systems” means those information systems operated by Federal Civilian Executive Branch Agencies, but excludes National Security Systems.
(f) the term “Federal Information Systems” means an information system used or operated by an agency or by a contractor of an agency or by another organization on behalf of an agency, including FCEB Information Systems and National Security Systems.
(g) the term “Intelligence Community” or “IC” has the meaning ascribed to it under 50 U.S.C. 3003(4).
(h) the term “National Security Systems” means information systems as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3552(b)(6), 3553(e)(2), and 3553(e)(3).
(i) the term “logs” means records of the events occurring within an organization’s systems and networks. Logs are composed of log entries, and each entry contains information related to a specific event that has occurred within a system or network.
(j) the term “Software Bill of Materials” or “SBOM” means a formal record containing the details and supply chain relationships of various components used in building software. Software developers and vendors often create products by assembling existing open source and commercial software components. The SBOM enumerates these components in a product. It is analogous to a list of ingredients on food packaging. An SBOM is useful to those who develop or manufacture software, those who select or purchase software, and those who operate software. Developers often use available open source and third-party software components to create a product; an SBOM allows the builder to make sure those components are up to date and to respond quickly to new vulnerabilities. Buyers can use an SBOM to perform vulnerability or license analysis, both of which can be used to evaluate risk in a product. Those who operate software can use SBOMs to quickly and easily determine whether they are at potential risk of a newly discovered vulnerability. A widely used, machine-readable SBOM format allows for greater benefits through automation and tool integration. The SBOMs gain greater value when collectively stored in a repository that can be easily queried by other applications and systems. Understanding the supply chain of software, obtaining an SBOM, and using it to analyze known vulnerabilities are crucial in managing risk.
(k) the term “Zero Trust Architecture” means a security model, a set of system design principles, and a coordinated cybersecurity and system management strategy based on an acknowledgement that threats exist both inside and outside traditional network boundaries. The Zero Trust security model eliminates implicit trust in any one element, node, or service and instead requires continuous verification of the operational picture via real-time information from multiple sources to determine access and other system responses. In essence, a Zero Trust Architecture allows users full access but only to the bare minimum they need to perform their jobs. If a device is compromised, zero trust can ensure that the damage is contained. The Zero Trust Architecture security model assumes that a breach is inevitable or has likely already occurred, so it constantly limits access to only what is needed and looks for anomalous or malicious activity. Zero Trust Architecture embeds comprehensive security monitoring; granular risk-based access controls; and system security automation in a coordinated manner throughout all aspects of the infrastructure in order to focus on protecting data in real-time within a dynamic threat environment. This data-centric security model allows the concept of least-privileged access to be applied for every access decision, where the answers to the questions of who, what, when, where, and how are critical for appropriately allowing or denying access to resources based on the combination of sever.
Sec. 11. General Provisions.
(a) Upon the appointment of the National Cyber Director (NCD) and the establishment of the related Office within the Executive Office of the President, pursuant to section 1752 of Public Law 116-283, portions of this order may be modified to enable the NCD to fully execute its duties and responsibilities.
(b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
(c) This order shall be implemented in a manner consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
(d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
(e) Nothing in this order confers authority to interfere with or to direct a criminal or national security investigation, arrest, search, seizure, or disruption operation or to alter a legal restriction that requires an agency to protect information learned in the course of a criminal or national security investigation.

"There is no way to know if Goldstein is a real person or not. All of the historical records in Oceania are constantly edited, and Goldstein is never seen outside of a telescreen. He is more likely just a scapegoat for the Party.
Emmanuel Goldstein is the direct opposite of Big Brother. Though it is said that the two were once close associates, Big Brother now represents leadership, while Goldstein is the enemy.
Emmanuel Goldstein represents the effectiveness of the Party's propaganda tools. Though the people of Oceania have no actual evidence that Goldstein exists, they happily accept that Goldstein is at fault for all of Oceania's problems.
1984 is a dystopian novel written by George Orwell and published in 1949. The novel tells the story of Winston Smith, a man living in the totalitarian state of Oceania. Winston is an employee of the Ministry of Truth, one of the four ministries run by the authoritarian government, and he is responsible for rewriting historical documents in order to fit the current narrative of the Party. He develops a desire to overthrow the government, but is ultimately unsuccessful in doing so. Instead, he is tortured back into submission; and he claims at the end to love Big Brother , the symbolic leader of Oceania. Orwell wrote 1984 as a warning against allowing authoritarian governments to exist. He wanted to highlight the potential dangers of these governments in a time when regimes like Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia were at the forefront of everyone's minds. The novel has remained relevant to this day, as people often bring it up in reference to surveillance and censorship.
Emmanuel Goldstein is a character in 1984, though his actual existence is questionable. This lesson will discuss exactly who Emmanuel Goldstein is, provide an analysis of his character, and examine the relationship between Goldstein and the enigmatic Big Brother.

Emmanuel Goldstein is known as the enemy of the government and Oceania, and a significant amount of hate is directed towards him.
Emmanuel Goldstein is presented as the main enemy of the state and, more specifically, of Big Brother. He is a former member of the Inner Party, the elite group that controls Oceania. He is portrayed as an ugly, evil man on telescreens all across Oceania. It is said that he left the Party some time ago in order to form the Brotherhood in an effort to overthrow Big Brother. He is referred to as a traitor and used as a scapegoat , or a person to blame, for all of the government's problems.
In addition to being the primary enemy of the state, Goldstein is also the author of an in-novel text titled The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism. The book is heavy and black, and is typically referred to as just, ""The Book."" This novel contains entirely negative information about Oceania, Big Brother, the Party, and Ingsoc. It outlines issues like the struggle between classes, the reliance on propaganda to control the masses, the rationing of goods to keep the citizens at a low quality of life, the impression of constant war to benefit the government, and many others. Winston is given a copy of this book by his coworker, O'Brien, and begins to read it with his lover, Julia. He only manages to get through a couple of chapters before he is arrested and tortured for his crimes, soon discovering that O'Brien was conspiring against him all along.
Emmanuel Goldstein receives the blame for the problems that exist in Oceania. He is likely a scapegoat for the Party.

Cognitive Learning Theory

Cognitive learning theory explains how internal and external factors influence an individual’s mental processes to supplement learning.

Delays and difficulties in learning are seen when cognitive processes are not working regularly. These processes are such as attention, observation, retrieval from long-term memory, and categorization.

Several researchers have made significant contributions to this theory. Jerome Bruner focused on how mental processes are linked to teaching.

[2] Of course it's not a huge deal if the cable falls out of the computer, which is also why you don't have to use the screws if you don't want to. However, it's usually safer to use them to prevent accidental disconnection (saves you the headache of checking behind your computer every time your monitor blanks out), and indeed, a typical VGA/DVI connector lacks the physical holding pressure a standard USB connector does.

HDMI interface is too shallow, it always feels unstable, and the connector interface will be loose if plug in too often. But there are many reasons why the HDMI HD cable does not come with screws universally:
1、If the HDMI is attached with a screw, it is likely to cause a lot of problems with the format of the screw and the screw hole diameter. After all, the selection and process of each manufacturer are inconsistent.
2、Equipment manufacturers should reserve the screw position, screw thread diameter and other issues, need to increase the cost of communication with the manufacturer, and is not suitable for the trend of precision equipment in the new era.
3、At the beginning of the design, designer wanted to support the hot plugging of the HDMI high-definition cable. If it is fixed, it will become unworthy.

A new Big Brother 25 HOH
The HOH Competition was based on Instagram-like photos shared on the house screens. The houseguests got to see them ahead of time and were then quizzed on what they saw.
Eight people answered questions about what they had seen. It was done in rounds, with players answering true or false.
The competition finished in a tie between Bowie Jane and Felicia (perfect scores).
The tie-breaker question was to name the number of minutes for how long Jared Fields was a zombie.
Bowie Jane won the challenge by getting the closest number.
This is the first time Bowie Jane has won a competition. She is now the Head of Household for Week 10.
Bowie Jane will host a Nomination Ceremony on Friday (October 6). Who will she target? Stay tuned!

"Conclusions: Cryotherapy is likely to prevent TIPN in patients receiving taxanes. High quality and sufficient amount of evidence is warranted.

Results: We analyzed 2250 patients from 9 trials. Assessments using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) score showed that cryotherapy could significantly reduce the incidence of motor and sensory neuropathy of grade≥2 (sensory: RR 0.65, 95%CI 0.56 to 0.75, p <0.00001; motor: RR 0.18, 95% CI [0.03, 0.94], p =0.04). When evaluated using the Patient Neuropathy Questionnaire (PNQ), cryotherapy demonstrated significant reduction in the incidence of sensory neuropathy (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.31], p <0.0001), but did not show significant reduction in the incidence of motor neuropathy (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.88, p =0.28). Cryotherapy was associated with reduced incidences of taxane dose reduction due to TIPN (RR 0.48, 95% CI [0.24, 0.95], p =0.04) and had potential to preserve motor nerves.

"Playoffs, Basketball, Elsewhere: In NCAA Division I basketball conferences, a playoff or ""postseason tournament"" is held after the regular season. Most conferences, including all of the ""major"" basketball conferences (ACC, American, Big East, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12, SEC), hold their tournaments at a predetermined venue, with all conference teams participating (unless barred due to NCAA sanctions). A few conferences hold early rounds at campus sites and later rounds at a predetermined site. For example, the Mid-American Conference holds its first-round games at campus sites, but the rest of the tournament in Cleveland. The Big South Conference holds its first round at campus sites, gives hosting rights for its quarterfinals and semifinals to the regular-season champion, and plays its final at the home court of the top remaining seed. The America East Conference, ASUN Conference, and Patriot League hold all tournament games at campus sites. A small number of conferences do not invite all of their teams to the conference tournament, with one example being the Ivy League, in which only four of the eight members advance to the tournament (which is at a predetermined site).

"Unidentified woman from 1988 Georgia cold case identified using Genealogy Technology
In a significant development in a 1988 cold case, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) announced they have successfully identified the human remains discovered in a Jenkins County dumpster on February 14, 1988. The victim, according to GBI officials, has been identified as Chong Un Kim, a 26-year-old individual who immigrated to the United States from Korea in 1981 and resided in Hinesville, Liberty County, Georgia.
According to the GBI, investigators were called upon by the Jenkins County Sheriff's Office to assist in a death investigation in 1988. The victim was found wrapped in plastic and duct tape inside a large nylon suitcase, which had been placed in a dumpster just north of Millen, Georgia, according to officials. Tragically, per the GBI, the victim had been deceased for approximately four to seven days, with the cause of death determined to be asphyxiation.
GBI officials stated that throughout the investigation, efforts to identify the victim included the comparison of fingerprints and dental records with missing persons nationwide. Additionally, a forensic artist created a sketch of the victim, which was shared with the public.
National organizations such as the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NAMUS) and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) joined the efforts, disseminating a computer-generated sketch. Although DNA technology evolved over the years, previous submissions to the GBI Crime Lab failed to provide profiles eligible for entry into the CODIS DNA Database, per an official statement from the GBI.
According to officials, in 2023, the GBI initiated collaboration with Othram, Inc., a Texas-based company specializing in advanced DNA testing to solve cases. Through advanced DNA analysis, a genealogical search generated investigative leads, eventually leading to the identification of Chong Un Kim. The GBI stated they notified Kim's family about the breakthrough in October 2023, marking a significant development in the case.
Notably, per GBI officials, the DNA testing was funded by ""Project Justice.""
The GBI is now appealing to anyone who may have known Chong Un Kim or possesses information related to the case to contact them at 912-871-1121. Anonymous tips can be submitted via phone, online at https://gbi.georgia.gov/submit-tips-online, or through the See Something, Send Something mobile app.","The victim, Chong Un Kim, a 26-year-old Korean immigrant, was found dead in a dumpster in Jenkins County.",1,1,0.9842274785041809

""When engaged in an activity that's enjoyable such as binge watching, your brain produces dopamine,"" she explains.

Medication duration: Succinate (toprol) is the long acting form of metoprolol where as tartrate (lopressor) is the shorter acting form. Toprol can be taken once a day and Lopressor is usually taken at least twice a day.\n\npassage 2:Tartrate vs Succinate. The key difference between tartrate and succinate is that succinate is derived from the succinic acid and tartrate is derived from the tartaric acid. These two chemical substances are widely used in the beverage industry and drug manufacturing.Succinic acid is ethan-1,2-dicarboxylic acid. Succinate form of metoprolol is an extended release drug and it plays its role in the circulatory system for 24 hours. However, the tartrate form of metoprolol does not appear in the blood stream for 24 hours because metoprolol tartrate is an immediate-release drug.\n\npassage 3:Release time. The primary difference between metoprolol succinate and metoprolol tartrate is the length of time that the drugs stay in your bloodstream. Metoprolol succinate will stay in a person's bloodstream for 24 complete hours. This means that the medication is a once per day pill.Metoprolol tartrate, on the other hand, will not stay in the bloodstream as long and thus needs to be taken at regular intervals.etoprolol succinate has a greater dehydrating effect. Thus, the side effects constipation and dry mouth are primarily associated with this version of the medication. Conversely, metoprolol tartrate may cause diarrhea. It also has the potential to cause sleep issues such as insomnia or unusual dreams.\n\n""}","Duration of action: Succinate (Toprol) is a long-acting form of metoprolol, while tartrate (Lopressor) is a shorter-acting form.",1,1,0.810589611530304

Current diagnostic protocols for chronic cough have been based on the work of Irwin and colleagues first reported over 20 years ago.5 The foundation for this approach was an appreciation of the anatomical sites of receptors comprising the afferent limb of the human cough reflex. This approach has been termed the “anatomic diagnostic protocol”. Using a combination of history, physical examination, and laboratory investigations directed at these sites, possible causes for the cough were considered. The suspected cause could then be confirmed if the cough resolved or significantly improved after a trial of diagnosis specific treatment.

"[1] The EU confirmed Thursday that it would retaliate against steel and aluminum tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, in what many European officials fear could be the first salvos of a transatlantic trade war.
Over recent days, European leaders had hoped that Washington would exempt the EU from tariffs, or would instead impose a quota system. Trump, however, ultimately decided to roll out the full 25 percent additional tariff on steel, and 10 percent on aluminum as originally threatened.
""We will now trigger a dispute settlement case at the WTO, since these U.S. measures clearly go against agreed international rules. We will also impose rebalancing measures and take any necessary steps to protect the EU market from trade diversion caused by these U.S. restrictions,"" said European Commissioner for Trade Cecilia Malmström.
The European Union has already notified the World Trade Organization of plans to levy duties on about $7 billion worth of U.S. exports in response, with the aim of collecting $1.6 billion in tariff revenue.

[2] The European Union on Thursday said they will take retaliatory action against the United States in response to the Trump administration’s decision to issue hefty steel and aluminum tariffs.The EU and the United States failed to reach an agreement on an exemption from the duties despite having spent the better part of the past two months trying to hammer out a deal that would provide a waiver from the tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports announced by President Trump[Image]Donald Trump

[3] The EU said it will file a case against the United States at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and take retaliatory action, most likely in the form of reciprocal tariffs.

"[1] Through five albums, Tupac had found a crucial equilibrium. He was looking outward and inward in roughly equal measure; he was living precariously in the moment just as much as he was looking to the future. The slew of posthumous material that’s been released in the years since his death offsets that balance, and muddies the fairly linear progression that his proper albums reveal. It’s impossible to know where Pac would have gone two, five, ten years after All Eyez on Me, but it seems unlikely that he’d be stuck on the sort of creative plateau that posthumous releases necessarily land on.

[2] 2Pac’s estate has finally won the battle over his unreleased music. Entertainment One had to fork over a six-figure settlement for unpaid royalties from posthumous releases they had managed, TMZ reports. The estate sued Entertainment One because the estate claimed it had missed out on royalties worth seven figures.
The estate was administered by 2Pac’s mother, Afeni Shakur, who sued Entertainment One in 2013 to recover the unreleased master recordings that 2Pac had made. Though Afeni passed away in 2016, the lawsuit went on, and was overseen by the estate’s other trustees. Now, all the unreleased recordings—which hold a lot of value—will go back to the estate.

[3] While it remains unclear whether Afeni had codified her final wishes, she did make sure her son was protected. According to TMZ, Tupac’s mother created a trust that controlled all of the “California Love” rapper’s music rights. A rep for the West Coast rapper's estate says Afeni was careful when writing up the paperwork, leaving nothing to chance. She even went as far as choosing an executor for the slain musician’s music rights, naming former Warner Bros. executive Tom Whalley. The trust outlines heirs to Tupac’s fortune, naming charities and family members that Afeni selected to inherit a portion.

"TITLE: J.J. Watt, Jared Allen, Jake Long among NFL's best linemen - NFL.com ## Analysis # J.J. Watt, Jared Allen, Jake Long among NFL's best linemen By Gil Brandt NFL Media senior analyst Published: Oct. 24, 2012 at 02:46 p.m. Updated: Oct. 24, 2012 at 08:47 p.m. 0 Likes 0 Comments Friend(s) Email Your Email By Gil Brandt Ten rookies drafted in Round 2 or later primed to make an impact in Year 1 The top 10 free agent signings of 2019 More Columns > The midpoint of the season is almost here, and folks are no doubt preparing lists of first-half all-stars. While they'll have a relatively easy time picking out the best quarterbacks, receivers and running backs, I thought I'd lend them a hand and round up the top offensive and defensive linemen so far this year. I've ranked the five best offensive and defensive linemen according to how they've played thus far this season. I've also listed the top five up-and-comers on each side of the ball, based on both game tape and future potential. On the defensive side of the ball, I included some outside linebackers, since they share similar pass-rushing responsibilities to their D-line brethren. There are a high number of quality linemen in the NFL, and some very good players were left off these lists. I tried to forget the players' reputations -- dismissing what I already knew about these guys -- and just rank them according to how they've performed on the field in 2012. ### DEFENSIVE LINEMEN ESTABLISHED STARS 1. J.J. Watt, DE, Houston TexansWatt, who has 18 pressures and a league-leading 9.5 sacks, is a pass-tipping machine; he's caused four interceptions with his ability to get his fingers on the ball. Watt has long arms, very strong hands and a rare combination of speed, strength and athletic ability. He's an early favorite to be the Defensive Player of the Year in 2012. 2. Jason Pierre-Paul, DE, New York GiantsA third-year player who burst onto the scene with 16.5 sacks in 2011, Pierre-Paul has continued his quarterback-harassing ways, collecting 4.5 sacks and forcing one fumble through the first seven games of the season. 3. DeMarcus Ware, LB, Dallas CowboysA former high school receiver, Ware has accumulated 106 sacks and 30 forced fumbles through eight seasons, and the likely Hall of Famer hasn't shown any signs of slowing down. In six games, Ware has 6.5 sacks and three forced fumbles. He has a great first step and can play in space at times. 4. Geno Atkins, DT, Cincinnati BengalsAtkins underachieved somewhat at Georgia, but those days are behind him. Very powerful and quick, Atkins has seven sacks in seven games this season after totaling 7.5 in a breakout 2011 campaign. 5. Jared Allen, DE, Minnesota VikingsLike a big wind-up toy, Allen never slows down. The veteran, in his ninth season, is a big reason that the Vikings are 5-2. He has six sacks in 2011, bringing his career total to 111. UP-AND-COMERS 1. Aldon Smith, LB, San Francisco 49ersAfter collecting 14 sacks in his rookie season, Smith continues to improve and has learned to play the run a lot better in 2012. Smith, who has 5.5 sacks this season, possesses great speed and a quick first step for a pass rusher. 2. Robert Quinn, DE, St. Louis RamsThe 14th overall pick in the 2011 NFL Draft, Quinn has already surpassed last season's sack total (five), racking up seven through the first seven games of 2012. Quinn, who can also block kicks, has a great first step, long arms and can run the 40-yard dash in less than 4.7 seconds. 3. Chandler Jones, DE, New England PatriotsThe rookie has been much better as a pro than I thought he was going to be, forcing three fumbles and posting 5.5 sacks while starting every game in 2012. Jones has very long arms and can play the run. 4. Henry Melton, DT, Chicago BearsOne of the best running backs to ever play high school football in the Dallas area , Melton also spent two years as a ball carrier at Texas before switching to defensive tackle. Melton is nearing his sack total from 2011 (seven) after just seven games this season, collecting 4.5 so far. He has unbelievable athletic ability and the quickness needed to succeed. 5. Gerald McCoy, DT, Tampa Bay BuccaneersMcCoy battled injuries through the early part of his career, but he's found success this season, starting all six games so far and notching three sacks and one forced fumble. McCoy is very quick and disruptive; he needed to add more strength, and did so. ### OFFENSIVE LINEMEN ESTABLISHED STARS 1. Duane Brown, T, Houston TexansBrown is a very good run blocker who also has yet to give up a sack or a hurry this season. A very athletic and smart player who's gotten a lot stronger, Brown was just the second offensive lineman in Texans history to start all 16 games of his rookie campaign back in 2008. 2. Ryan Clady, T, Denver BroncosClady is as reliable as they get, having started 70 straight games for the Broncos. The strong and athletic Clady does well in the run game, and has not given up a sack or a hurry this year. 3. Carl Nicks, G, Tampa Bay BuccaneersThe very strong fifth-year player has been worth every penny he got in the $47.5 million, five-year contract he signed with the Bucs last offseason. Nicks excels as a run blocker and has yet to allow a single sack or hurry. 4. Joe Thomas, T, Cleveland BrownsThomas has good athletic ability and knows where to put his hands. The durable veteran (he's started every game for six years) does not make mistakes: He's given up just two sacks and been called just twice for holding all season. As is true of most of the offensive linemen on this list, Thomas has long arms, which help him fend off defensive linemen. Arm length is very important for the position, because it's one of the few quantifiable indicators of future success. 2013 Pro Bowl (Jan. 27, 2013; 7 p.m. ET on NBC) The game: » Complete coverage | Rosters | Tickets » On Twitter: #ProBowl More: » Darlington: Losing stinks; Hawaii doesn't » Mind-blowing Pro Bowl stats » Getting to know the men behind the masks Video: » Kriegel: Pro Bowl not worth saving » Luck mic'd at AFC practice » Brees has fun at NFC practice » Two vets ready to enhance Pro Bowl Photos: » Practices | Scene | cheerleaders 5. Jake Long, T, Miami DolphinsLong has come up big for rookie quarterback Ryan Tannehill, allowing just two sacks this season in six games. One of just three offensive linemen to be selected first overall in the NFL draft since 1967 (the Dolphins picked in him in 2008), Long has great athletic ability, strength and length. UP-AND-COMERS 1. Sebastian Vollmer, T, New England PatriotsA very big man (listed at 6-foot-8, 320 pounds) with good feet and long arms, Vollmer has allowed just one sack and one hurry this season. The Patriots have done a lot to make the German native stronger in the four years that he's been in the NFL. 2. Mike Iupati, G, San Francisco 49ersNiners offensive line coach Mike Solari gets credit for developing Iupati, a powerful and large (6-5, 331) man with long arms who has become a huge asset in the run game in his third year as a pro. He's a big reason why the 49ers (who ranked eighth with 127.8 rushing yards per game in 2011 and are second with 176.6 per game this season) have had such success on the ground. 3. Alex Mack, C, Cleveland BrownsMack, a very strong, quick and smart fourth-year center, very seldom allows the man he's blocking to make a play. Like his linemate Thomas, the big-handed, long-armed Mack is durable and reliable, having started 55 consecutive games. He hasn't allowed a sack or hurry this season. 4. Tyron Smith, T, Dallas CowboysCowboys offensive line coach Bill Callahan, who is one of the best in the business, told me before a recent game that Smith, a second-year man playing his first season at left tackle, is the real deal. Smith has very long arms and big hands (36.5 inches), and is an excellent athlete with good work habits. The only negative surrounding his game? The five false-start penalties he's incurred. But Callahan will correct that. 5. Nate Solder, T, New England PatriotsA one-time high school tight end, Solder (the 17th overall pick in the 2011 NFL Draft) has put in a lot of effort to add core strength. Solder is very athletic and smart, and has great work habits. He's versatile (can play left or right tackle) and will be around for a very long time. He's given up just two sacks this season. ### COLLEGE CLIMBERS Ezekiel Ansah, LB, BYU: Ansah originally went to BYU with the intention of being a track athlete, but he started playing football in 2010 and hasn't looked back since. The 6-foot-5 1/2, 270-pound middle linebacker most likely will be a defensive end prospect, and could be a top-50 player. Kyle Long, OL, Oregon: The son of Howie Long and brother of St. Louis Rams defensive end Chris Long, Kyle Long doesn't start, but he does contribute to the offensive line and will be drafted. Long originally was going to play baseball for Florida State, but ended up playing football at a junior college before transferring to Oregon. ### OTHER OBSERVATIONS Harrison: Week 8 Power Rankings Elliot Harrison reshuffles the NFL deck after yet another batch of games, with a new team cracking the top three. More ... » Phone Call of the Week: Last Thursday, the 49ers held on to win a bruising battle with the Seattle Seahawks. On Friday, Solari called me to say that those were the two best defensive teams he'd ever been involved with in one game. » I noticed two unsung heroes in Week 7. On defense, I'd like to highlight the performance of Minnesota Vikings defensive end Brian Robison, who had three sacks and a forced fumble in a win over the Arizona Cardinals. Offensively, New Orleans Saints receiver Joe Morgan stood out. Morgan, the first player from Walsh College to score a touchdown in the NFL, hauled in a highlight-reel catch from Drew Brees for his second scoring grab of the season. » New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning is dominant in October. When he helped the New York Giants beat the Washington Redskins, he improved to 26-5 in the month; his October winning rate of 84 percent is the best of any quarterback in that month in the Super Bowl era. ## Headlines Raiders GM: Time for A.B.

We arrived at noon and were the only ones there. The large and lush patio was great since the weather was nice, and my bowl of spicy soup noodles hit the spot. \n\nI used to live in Hong Kong and have traveled in Asia quite a bit. While I can\'t quite call what I ate ""traditional"" in some respects, it was delicious. For around $11.80, I got a big bowl of tasty mala soup (at just the right spice level after I asked for it ""da la"" 大麻) with four ingredients. \n\nI chose vermicelli, broccoli, Chinese cabbage, and tofu rolls. Each was super tasty! I was a little disappointed as I had asked the friendly cashier/server if the tofu roll was the crispy beancurd roll from hotpot and he said yes, but it wasn\'t. It was more like rolled tofu skin--still tasty though. The broccoli was fresh and perfectly cooked, and the cabbage soaked up the delicious mala oils while the vermicelli provided the ""umph"" to the dish. The soup came topped with sliced spring onions and a generous dollop of chili sauce with sesame seeds. \n\nA little while into our meal, the server came over with two cups of mung bean soup for my friend and I. He said the chef had decided to make up a batch and gave it to us on the house. It was a nice balance of sweet to match the spicy soup, and had a liberal serving of perfectly cooked mung beans at the bottom. \n\nThe only downside was the place\'s lack of nice utensils. Though I ordered my meal ""for here,"" it came with a small plastic spoon and disposable wooden chopsticks. I carry my own chopsticks, so no worries there (BYO people, be green!), but the spoon was sad. I want to eat a lovely soup like that with a proper Chinese soup spoon that has room for me to arrange the perfect bite with my chopsticks. The silly little plastic one just didn\'t cut it.

"Music Copyright 101: How to copyright your music and compositions as an artist, songwriter, or producer

As an independent musician, you own your songs and recordings. It’s YOUR intellectual property.

That might seem obvious, but it’s worth repeating: YOU control the copyright to the songs you write and the recordings you create. Ownership of your music copyright gives you leverage, protection, and power when it comes to making money from your music catalog.

In this article we’ll provide an overview of what music copyright is, how to copyright your music, and how you can use your copyright as a songwriter or artist to earn money.

What is music copyright?

Copyright signifies the ownership of intellectual property by a person or group.

Music copyright also grants certain exclusive rights to the owner(s), one of the most important being the right to earn money from that intellectual property. This is called “exploiting” your copyright. We’ll get into that more later.

"Every morning, Sissa Abu Dahou puts on traditional male dress, known as a jalabiya, and heads into the streets of the Egyptian city of Luxor for a day of hard work. But this man of the house is actually a woman. The grandmother of two has dressed as a man for 43 years to avoid oppression and eek out a living in the conservative Muslim state. ""Why did you do this mother?"" her daughter asked during a recorded interview with Egyptian television network CBC. ""Your father died and I was six months pregnant with you."" she replied. ""None of my siblings helped me. I raised you and sent you to school. Without money I could not have gotten you an education."" A widow at just 21, Dahou was forced to fend for herself in Egypt's patriarchal south, where decades ago it was unheard of for women to earn their own living. Even in recent years, women make up barely 24% of Egypt's workforce, according to the World Bank. ""It is considered wrong that I dressed as a man but no one can judge. Not you or anyone else. Only God can judge me,"" Dahou said, ""People talked but I said I decided to be a man so I can take care of my small daughter."" The breadwinner worked as a brick maker for just 25 piasters, the equivalent of a few cents, until she saved up enough money to buy a shoeshine kit.  She found a place for her wooden box, painted with red hearts and the Egyptian flag, alongside the all-male shoe shiners of her community. ""If it wasn't for my mother, I would have been on the streets"" Houda, her daughter, told TV host Mona al-Shazly through tears. ""Honestly I would have been in the streets. I did not find a home except with my mother. And even today my children rely on her."" The years of sun and sand weathered and darkened Dahou's face and left her with a voice so deep and raspy she can easily be mistaken for a man. Her only child, Houda, eventually married and had two children of her own. Through the years the one-time housewife dreamed of owning her own business one day, a small street stand to sell snacks and cigarettes.  After her interview on CBC television, the governor of Luxor province offered Dahou a kiosk and a cash advance. The maverick had one requirement- she would only agree to meet with the governor in male attire. ""Even if I die, I will not take it off,"" Dahou said as she pulled on the male jalabiya in front of a TV camera, ""When I had to dress in a woman's jalabiya when I went to Cairo I felt suffocated. No, I thank God. I don't want anyone to look at me or look at my daughter."" Now the 65-year-old who earned respect as a man has gained praise as a woman. Egypt's President, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, crowned her as one of Egypt's ideal mothers in an official ceremony last month. ""If I was really a man, I would not have done this,"" Dahou told her daughter, ""I would have gotten remarried. I would have left you who knows where. You would have been treated without dignity or left homeless. Thank God I was able to protect you.""

"They come from more than 20 countries, drawn to Libya as the funnel to Europe. Eritreans want to escape repression or military service; Somalis flee Al-Shabaab and clan warfare; Syrians have given up hope of returning home. In villages in Senegal and elsewhere across West Africa, young men sell all they have in the hope of a better life in Europe, perhaps hoping to join a cousin or brother who made it. Motivations among the tens of thousands making the trek to the Mediterranean coast are as many and varied as the nationalities involved, according to researchers and human rights groups. But in 2014 more than 80% of them headed for the Libyan coast as the easiest point of embarkation. From the Horn of Africa to the Atlantic, from Syria and Gaza, these would-be migrants travel well-established smuggling routes. Along the way they must cross deserts and mountains, risk kidnap or robbery, are often cheated or left stranded. One African migrant reported surviving on toothpaste for days. A teenage Somali who made it to Malta told researchers that he had warned other family members not to come. ""I tell them its 95% sure that you will die,"" he said. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has tracked the migrant flows through North Africa for years. Eritreans have long been prominent among the travelers, escaping an authoritarian government, poverty and indefinite military service -- a land without possibilities. ""Many conscripts are not demobilized from the military as scheduled and some were forced to serve indefinitely under threats of detention, torture, or punishment of their families,"" according to a report by the Regional Mixed Migration Secretariat (RMMS) in Nairobi last year. They travel to Sudan, so long as they can avoid kidnap by tribes on the border, and are handed from one group of smugglers to the next in relay. One Eritrean woman told the UN Refugee agency (UNHCR) this month that she had paid $5,000 to reach the Mediterranean. Eritreans and Syrians made up half of the migrant traffic to Europe last year, according to Arezo Malakooti, director of migration research at Altai Consulting and author of one of the most detailed studies of migration patterns. Malakooti has recently visited seven countries, including Libya, Tunisia and Morocco to update her study. The ""push factor"" is much greater than the ""pull"" of Europe, she says. Upheavals and instability across much of Africa and the Middle East -- combined with the perception that Libya's doors are open -- have led to a massive increase in the numbers trying to reach Libya. ""Worsening repression in Eritrea"" has been one factor, she says -- while Eritreans already in refugee camps in Sudan have decided to make a dash for the Mediterranean. One reason is that other routes -- through Saudi Arabia and to Israel -- have become more difficult: Israel has adopted a much tougher approach on would-be Eritrean migrants trying to enter the country through the Sinai desert, including detention, and Yemen's implosion has cut off that conduit. As one Eritrean told the humanitarian journal IRIN last year: ""People were traveling to Israel because it was the only way, and now they're traveling to Europe because it's the only way."" Somalis, often seen as the third most numerous nationality among migrants headed to the Mediterranean, face a perfect storm of crises. ""Extreme poverty; prolonged insecurity; sexual violence and other serious human rights violations; lack of access to basic needs such as food, medical services, healthcare and livelihoods"" are all contributory factors, says the RMMS. Sea-tossed storm of human misery hits Italian shores. The IOM told CNN it is seeing a spike in would-be migrants from Senegal, Mali, Guinea and Gambia in West Africa. Many reason that Libya's chaos is an opportunity: border posts are left abandoned, the coastline unguarded. Most West Africans make the journey for economic reasons; the majority are single men in their twenties. Populations in the region are swelling but farmland and economic security shrinking. Often, say researchers, the oldest son leaves to find work so he can remit funds home -- perhaps misled by fables of riches. Malakooti noted in a recent report that ""unrealistic expectations of their migration is fueled by migrants in destination who rarely send negative news home because of the pressure on them to succeed."" But West Africans who have sold livestock or other possessions only to be caught or stranded can face destitution when they return home: 400 Senegalese were recently repatriated from Libya by the Red Cross and IOM. Malians have the added incentive of the recent conflict in which jihadist groups seized nearly half the country before French-led intervention pushed them back. Joel Millman of the IOM says there's also been an increase in the number of Nigerian Christians following this route, escaping the chaos and brutality inflicted on their towns and villages by Boko Haram. Another disturbing phenomenon, according to Malakooti, is the trafficking of African women for prostitution to Italy through Libya. While still a small fraction of the overall migration, the number of women smuggled for sexual exploitation in Europe rose threefold in 2014, she says. Why migrants are risking their lives to reach Italy. A Geneva-based group, the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, estimated last year that about half of West African migrants pass through the town of Agadez in northern Niger. A crackdown in 2013 on organized convoys leaving Agadez stemmed the flow for a while, but gangs from the Toubou tribe, which controls the cross-border trade, developed new routes and raised their prices. A migrant might pay as much as $300 to reach southern Libya in a truck or pick-up, according to researchers. Reliable figures on the numbers passing through Agadez are difficult to come by, but the consensus among experts is somewhere between 2,000 and 7,000 every month. Other hubs include Khartoum in Sudan, a way-station for migrants from East Africa, and Tamanrasset in southern Algeria, where a fake Malian passport aids passage. Algeria has also been a destination for Syrian refugees, but new visa requirements have forced them to seek other routes -- often through Turkey and the Greek islands. Hundreds of thousands of other migrants have already been in Libya for years, attracted to jobs as day laborers when Moammar Gadhafi was in power. Now they face violence, discrimination and religious persecution -- and are unable even to remit home what little they earn. So at least some are embarking on a journey to Europe they never intended to take. Malakooti believes this is a major factor in the rising numbers trying to reach Europe. The recent murder of Egyptian and Ethiopian Christians by ISIS's Libyan affiliate may have hastened the departure of some. A similar dynamic applies to Syrian refugees. ""Initially, they remained in Lebanon, Jordan and other neighboring countries to wait out the conflict,"" says Malakooti. Now they've given up, or the resources to accommodate them have evaporated -- and have decided to try to reach Europe and start over. Within Libya, the smugglers for the most part appear to be small groups or individuals rather than large networks, according to human rights organizations. They cluster in dusty towns such as Sabha and Qatrun and use what are known as 'connection houses.' How is Europe going to tackle migrant crisis. Those driving migrants to Tripoli may have no connection with gangs at the coast. Such a journey, across the desert to avoid checkpoints, might cost a migrant $200: in a failed state that sort of cash quickly generates armed rivalries. Tribal feuds, roaming militias and criminal gangs mean migrants need the skills of a smuggler. The arrival of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in Libya has further complicated passage; in January jihadists killed 14 Libyan soldiers near Sabha. Malakooti detects a changing pattern since the Syrian conflict began. It has injected more money into the smuggling business, which has therefore become more organized. The more reliable groups can charge more; she says some migrants buy a ""package"" from smugglers that includes overland and sea travel. Syrian migrants are relatively better off than West Africans, and may pay more to guarantee a place on the top deck of a vessel. Africans are more often locked in the hold and are more vulnerable if a vessel sinks, or consigned to an inflatable dinghy. Fearing arrest, the smugglers rarely travel on the boats themselves, instead giving a compass or GPS device to the migrants, who then set off with no navigational skills and often no experience of the sea in boats that should never have left port. As Libya becomes more dangerous for migrants, other countries on both sides of the Mediterranean are looking on anxiously. Some West Africans opt to travel through Morocco -- even though the chances of detection there are much greater and the sea crossing to Spain very difficult. ""A migrant might need 50 or 60 attempts before making it to the Spanish coast,"" says Malakooti. Tunisia has massively increased security along its eastern border with Libya; both Algeria and Morocco have begun building fences along their border -- against both terrorism and clandestine migration. But they may be little deterrent. The Eritrean writer Abu Bakr Khaal made the desperate voyage to and across the Mediterranean himself. In his novel ""African Titanics,"" he describes the ""dangerous lure"" of escape. Only too late do the migrants discover a grim reality at sea:. ""'If God loved me he would not have brought me here,' groaned one of the passengers. Assured he had uttered the most fitting farewell to life, he threw himself into the sea. The boat moved forward at the whim of the waves."" Meet the couple on a mission to save drowning migrants.

"California Drug Kingpin Sentenced to Life in Prison for Meth Conspiracies in Oklahoma and Missouri
In a significant victory against drug trafficking, Luis Alfredo Jacobo, a California drug kingpin, has been sentenced to four life terms in federal prison. U.S. District Judge John C. Coughenour handed down this severe punishment, including one life sentence for directing a continuing criminal enterprise and three additional life sentences for drug conspiracy. Jacobo was also sentenced to four years on 21 counts of unlawful use of a communication facility, with all sentences to be served concurrently.
Jacobo, based in Bakersfield, California, orchestrated and directed multiple methamphetamine conspiracies that spanned Oklahoma and Missouri for over five years. His operations involved coordinating with more than a dozen individuals in California, Northeast Oklahoma, and Southwest Missouri.
Using Mexican sources of supply, Jacobo managed the distribution of methamphetamine, controlling pricing, methods of delivery, and payments. From 2016 to 2021, he received bulk shipments of meth in California and oversaw the transportation of the drugs to Oklahoma and Missouri, sometimes in quantities as large as 200 pounds. Cash proceeds were sent back to California, either driven by co-conspirators or mailed in sums of up to $100,000 from Oklahoma.
Three distinct drug conspiracies were operated by Jacobo's regional managers in Oklahoma, each selling methamphetamine under his direction. Numerous pieces of evidence, including communications and money exchanges related to the conspiracies, were presented during the trial, along with evidence from executed search warrants.
One significant discovery came when law enforcement uncovered 231 pounds of methamphetamine and over $465,000 in a storage unit in Grove, Oklahoma, in 2020. The storage unit was rented for Jacobo to store meth for distribution. In addition, officers arrested a codefendant, Tony Garcia, who was carrying 30 pounds of meth and a loaded handgun in Oklahoma City. Text messages on Garcia's phone indicated that he received instructions from Jacobo on the meth distribution.
Jacobo's conviction was the result of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Operation ""Pullin Chains,"" led by the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Drug Enforcement Administration. This operation targeted high-level drug traffickers and criminal organizations, employing a multi-agency approach to disrupt and dismantle these networks.

"Social Security Benefits to Increase by 3.2% in 2024
Los Angeles, California (LAI) - Over 66 million retirees receiving Social Security checks will see a 3.2% increase in their monthly government payments in 2024, thanks to the Social Security Administration's cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). The announcement was made by the Social Security Administration (SSA) on October 12, 2023.
On average, Social Security retirement monthly benefits will grow by more than $50 starting in January 2024. The COLA adjustment aims to help retirees keep up with increasing living expenses, providing a measure of inflation protection.
In addition to the COLA increase, other adjustments take effect every January based on the increase in average wages. As a result, the maximum amount of earnings subject to the Social Security tax (taxable maximum) will increase to $168,600 in 2024, up from $160,200 in 2023.
The annual COLA is tied to the increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, as determined by the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics. The CPI report indicates the impact of the Federal Reserve's efforts to combat inflation through interest rate hikes.
Beneficiaries will receive notices of the increase in early December, and those with a personal My Social Security account can view their COLA notice online. They can also set up text or email alerts for new messages regarding COLA until November 14.
For more information about Medicare changes for 2024, beneficiaries can visit www.medicare.gov.
The Senior Citizens League (TSCL) previously estimated a 3.2% COLA for 2024, based on consumer price data through August. While this is lower than the 8.7% COLA received in 2023, it is higher than the 20-year average of 2.6%.
A 3.2% COLA in 2024 would increase the average monthly retiree benefit of $1,790 by $57.30, according to the TSCL.
Key Points:
Social Security beneficiaries will see a 3.2% increase in their monthly government payments in 2024, with an average growth of over $50 starting in January.
The COLA adjustment aims to help retirees keep up with rising living expenses.
The maximum amount of earnings subject to the Social Security tax will increase to $168,600 in 2024.
Beneficiaries will receive notices of the COLA increase in early December.
The 2024 COLA is based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers.

"“The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control…”
– Galatians 5:22-23
Those who are in Christ are distinguished from unbelievers in that they have been gifted with the Holy Spirit, enabling them to bear fruit. In other words, their works demonstrate the change of sanctification that is at work in their hearts. What are these fruits, how does the Bible define them, and how are they displayed in our Christian walk? This is the first in a series of posts about the fruit of the Spirit, focusing on love, joy, and peace.
The Bible’s definition of love is very different from our world and culture’s definition today. While many define love as romance or a warm feeling, the Bible’s definition is fundamentally active, based not in what we feel, but rather what we do. Love is self-sacrifice, putting others’ needs before our own, following Jesus’ example and humbling ourselves as servants. As the familiar passage states:
“Love is patient, love is kind. It is not jealous, is not pompous, it is not inflated, it is not rude, it does not seek its own interests, it is not quick-tempered, it does not brood over injury, it does not rejoice over wrongdoing but rejoices with the truth. It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.” – 1 Corinthians 13:4-7
Outside of God, however, we are unable to love perfectly. It is only through the work of the Holy Spirit that we can set aside our sinfulness and our selfishness. Because God has shown us mercy, we are able to show mercy to others; because he has shown us love, we are able to show love to others:
“We love because he first loved us. If anyone says, ‘I love God,’ but hates his brother, he is a liar; for whoever does not love a brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen. This is the commandment we have from him: whoever loves God must also love his brother.” – 1 John 4:19-21
Joy is more than a temporary happiness; joy is lasting and based in more than simply an emotional reaction to our circumstances: it is an active choice of attitude. As followers of Christ, we rejoice, because in him, we have redemption.
“My lips will shout for joy as I sing your praise;
my soul, too, which you have redeemed.” – Psalm 71:23
When the troubles of this world assail us, we can rest in the comfort that only God can bring, and have joy, no matter our circumstances.
“When I say, ‘My foot is slipping,’
your mercy, LORD, holds me up.
When cares increase within me,
your comfort gives me joy.” – Psalm 94:18-19
The reason we can have joy is because we have eternal hope in Christ.
This world is full of strife and division, frustrated by sin and evil. As Christians, we are not spared from sin’s effects on the world, but we are able to take our worries to God through prayer.
“Have no anxiety at all, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, make your requests known to God. Then the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.” – Philippians 4:6-7
We also are able to take heart in the fact that Christ has triumphed over sin and death. In Him, we have peace in the knowledge that He is in control, and that no matter what struggles we face in this world, we will be granted ultimate eternal peace in Him.
“I have told you this so that you might have peace in me. In the world you will have trouble, but take courage, I have conquered the world.” – John 16:33","The fruits of the Holy Spirit are love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.",1,1,0.7637966275215149

"High altitudes

Ascent from sea level to high altitude has well-known effects upon respiration. The progressive fall in barometric pressure is accompanied by a fall in the partial pressure of oxygen, both in the ambient air and in the alveolar spaces of the lung, and it is this fall that poses the major respiratory challenge to humans at high altitude. Humans and some other mammalian species, such as cattle, adjust to the fall in oxygen pressure through the reversible process of acclimatization, which, whether undertaken deliberately or not, commences from the time of exposure to high altitudes. Indigenous mountain species, such as the llama, exhibit an adaptation that is heritable and has a genetic basis.

Respiratory acclimatization in humans is achieved through mechanisms that heighten the partial pressure of oxygen at all stages, from the alveolar spaces in the lung to the mitochondria in the cells, where oxygen is needed for the ultimate biochemical expression of respiration. The decline in the ambient partial pressure of oxygen is offset to some extent by greater ventilation, which takes the form of deeper breathing rather than a faster rate at rest. Diffusion of oxygen across the alveolar walls into the blood is facilitated, and in some experimental animal studies, the alveolar walls are thinner at altitude than at sea level. The scarcity of oxygen at high altitudes stimulates increased production of hemoglobin and red blood cells, which increases the amount of oxygen transported to the tissues. The extra oxygen is released by increased levels of inorganic phosphates in the red blood cells, such as 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG). With a prolonged stay at altitude, the tissues develop more blood vessels, and, as capillary density is increased, the length of the diffusion path along which gases must pass is decreased—a factor augmenting gas exchange. In addition, the size of muscle fibres decreases, which also shortens the diffusion path of oxygen.

The initial response of respiration to the fall of oxygen partial pressure in the blood on ascent to high altitude occurs in two small nodules, the carotid bodies, attached to the division of the carotid arteries on either side of the neck. As the oxygen deprivation persists, the carotid bodies enlarge but become less sensitive to the lack of oxygen. The low oxygen partial pressure in the lung is associated with thickening of the small blood vessels in pulmonary alveolar walls and a slight increase in pulmonary blood pressure, thought to enhance oxygen perfusion of the lung apices.

Indigenous mountain animals, such as the llama, alpaca, and vicuña in the Andes and the yak in the Himalayas, are adapted rather than acclimatized to the low oxygen partial pressures of high altitude. Their hemoglobin has a high oxygen affinity, so that full saturation of the blood with oxygen occurs at a lower partial pressure of oxygen. In contrast to acclimatized humans, these indigenous adapted mountain species do not have increased levels of hemoglobin or of organic phosphates in the red cells; they do not develop small muscular blood vessels or an increased blood pressure in the lung; and their carotid bodies remain small.

Native human highlanders are acclimatized rather than genetically adapted to the reduced oxygen pressure. After living many years at high altitude, some highlanders lose this acclimatization and develop chronic mountain sickness, sometimes called Monge disease, after the Peruvian physician who first described it. This disease is characterized by greater levels of hemoglobin. In Tibet some infants of Han origin never achieve satisfactory acclimatization on ascent to high altitude. A chemodectoma, or benign tumour, of the carotid bodies may develop in native highlanders in response to chronic exposure to low levels of oxygen.

More than 7,000 kilometers (4,400 miles) long and more than 500 kilometers (300 miles) wide in places, the Andes Mountains encompass a wide range of climates and habitats, from snow-capped mountain peaks to rainforests to high deserts. This picture, acquired by NASA’s Landsat 7 satellite, shows a dramatic change in landscape about 250 kilometers southeast of la Paz, the capital of Bolivia.

Some people who live at high altitudes suffer breathlessness, palpitations and dizziness, while others have no health problems, and now a new study reveals which genes may explain the difference.

The genetic changes, described today (Aug. 15) in the American Journal of Human Genetics, allow people to take in enough oxygen from the thin mountain air without developing the heart attacks and strokes of chronic mountain sickness.

""We have ascertained there is a major genetic component that allows populations at high altitude to live better,"" said study co-author Dr. Gabriel Haddad, a pediatric pulmonologist at the University of California at San Diego.

Mountain sickness

When people who live at low-altitude lowlands go to the highlands, the short-term lack of oxygen can cause acute mountain sickness, which brings headaches, nausea and brain swelling.

Some people, however, live all their lives at higher altitudes, yet still face chronic mountain sickness. To adapt to the lower oxygen content of the air, their bodies have increased the fraction of red blood cells, making their blood more viscous, which in turn makes it more likely that the cells will block blood vessels.

As a result, these people are more prone to heart attacks and strokes, Haddad said. They also suffer from fatigue, depression and headaches.

However, in populations where people's ancestors have lived for thousands of years at altitude, some people are able to get enough oxygen from the air without developing the increased risk of heart attacks and strokes.

Genetic adaptation

Haddad and his colleagues analyzed the genes of 20 people who lived at least 14,000 feet (4,300 meters) above sea level in the Andes Mountains, and whose ancestors had done so for generations. Half the people had signs of chronic mountain sickness. [High and Dry: Images of the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau]

Those people who had chronic problems tended to have differences in 11 gene regions, compared with those who did not have health problems.

The researchers inserted the genes from the well-adapted people into fruit flies, and placed the flies in low-oxygen chambers.

Fruit flies that had two of these mutations survived longer in the low-oxygen condition, suggesting those genes were responsible for the human adaptation to altitude. Still, the researchers said it remains unclear exactly how those genes work.

And while these two genes may have evolved to help people live at altitude, there are probably other mutations that also help them, and different populations around the world — for example people in the highlands of Ethiopia, or in the Himalayas — may have different mutations still, Haddad told LiveScience.

"[1] Condensation is the process where water vapor becomes liquid. It is the reverse of evaporation, where liquid water becomes a vapor.
Condensation happens one of two ways: Either the air is cooled to its dew point or it becomes so saturate d with water vapor that it cannot hold any more water.
Dew Point
Dew point is the temperature at which condensation happens. (Dew is simply condensed water in the atmosphere.) Air temperatures can reach or fall below the dew point naturally, as they often do at night. Thats why lawns, cars, and houses are often coated with water droplets in the morning.
Condensation can also produce water droplets on the outside of soda cans or glasses of cold water. When warm air hits the cold surface, it reaches its dew point and condenses. This leaves droplets of water on the glass or can.

[2] The drops of water on the outside of a cold cup come from the air.Believe it or not, there is a significant amount of water vapor in the air that we breathe. This is why we have humidity. A cold cup can take thermal energy out of the water vapor in the air next to the cup, causing the water vapor to condense into liquid water. The same kind of phenomena occurs when you take ice cream out of the freezer - you see frost on the outside of the container. In this case the cup (or ice cream container) is below the freezing point of water. Therefore, the water vapor from the air will freeze when it comes in contact with the container, forming a layer of frost.

[3] Ever wonder where those little drops of water on the outside of your cold can of soda pop or bottle of water come from? That’s condensation! Cold surfaces can cause water vapor in the air to cool down, condense and form tiny beads of liquid. The molecules in these miniscule droplets of water are grouped far more closely together than when they were in their gas phase, and exert less pressure—a fact that has some pretty cool physical implications.",This phenomenon is known as condensation.,1,1,0.978245735168457
"'Big Brother 25' Spoilers: Week 12 POV Competition Results, HOH Target's Fate Sealed?
Big Brother 25 (BB25) spoilers tease that a new Power of Veto winner has been crowned and has the opportunity to save one of the nominees from eviction. Big Brother Network reports that Jag Bains won the POV competition, giving him his fifth straight win (three POV wins and two HOH).
After Cory Wurtrnberger's 5-0 eviction vote on Thursday, Jag won the Head of Household (HOH) competition. He nominated Blue Kim and America Lopez for eviction. Jag told Matt Klotz that his target is Blue, adding he has no plans to save either nominee to ensure Blue's eviction.
Everyone played in the POV competition but Cirie. Jag won the competition, giving him the power to save one of the nominees.
Blue continues to try to get votes to stay in the house another week. Bowie Jane, and Matt want Blue to leave this week. With only four votes being cast, Jag needs one more vote to lock down Blue's eviction.
It seems unlikely that Cirie Fields would vote Blue out. Felica Cannon would likely vote to evict Blue to survive another week.
Jag may be in a good position right now on Big Brother, but a double eviction is coming. He cannot compete in the next HOH competition, which means Matt must win the HOH competition to keep Jag safe.
Big Brother 25 spoilers say that Blue's fate is likely sealed, but Matt must win the next HOH competition, or Jag will follow her during Thursday's live double eviction.

"Debunking the Hype: Xanax's Effectiveness for Treating Anxiety
Separating Fact from Fiction
In a world where anxiety disorders are increasingly prevalent, it's essential to understand the true effectiveness of medications like Xanax. This article will provide a clear, no-nonsense assessment of Xanax's role in anxiety treatment, dispelling any exaggerations that might have taken root in popular belief.
The Xanax Dilemma: Unraveling the Myths
Xanax, also known by its generic name alprazolam, is commonly prescribed to alleviate symptoms of anxiety. However, its effectiveness has been a subject of debate in medical circles.
Understanding Xanax's Mechanism of Action
Xanax belongs to a class of drugs called benzodiazepines, which work by enhancing the effects of a neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. This leads to a calming effect, reducing excessive brain activity that can contribute to anxiety.
The Short-Term Soother
Xanax is known for its rapid onset of action, providing quick relief for acute anxiety episodes. This makes it a valuable tool in emergency situations or for short-term use.
The Tolerance Conundrum
One of the primary concerns with Xanax is the potential for tolerance development. Over time, the body may become accustomed to the medication, necessitating higher doses for the same effect. This can lead to a cycle of increasing dosage, which poses risks for dependence and withdrawal symptoms.
Long-Term Considerations
For chronic anxiety management, other treatment options like therapy, lifestyle modifications, or alternative medications may be more sustainable. Long-term Xanax use requires careful monitoring and should be complemented with strategies to address the root causes of anxiety.
Conclusion: A Balanced Perspective
While Xanax can be an effective tool for managing acute anxiety, it's important to approach its use with caution and under the guidance of a healthcare professional. Understanding its benefits and limitations allows individuals to make informed decisions about their mental health treatment.
In the broader context of anxiety management, a holistic approach that incorporates various strategies is often the key to long-term well-being. Remember, no single solution fits all, and seeking professional advice is crucial in navigating the complexities of anxiety treatment.

"'Big Brother 25' Spoilers: Week 12 POV Competition Results, HOH Target's Fate Sealed?
Big Brother 25 (BB25) spoilers tease that a new Power of Veto winner has been crowned and has the opportunity to save one of the nominees from eviction. Big Brother Network reports that Jag Bains won the POV competition, giving him his fifth straight win (three POV wins and two HOH).
After Cory Wurtrnberger's 5-0 eviction vote on Thursday, Jag won the Head of Household (HOH) competition. He nominated Blue Kim and America Lopez for eviction. Jag told Matt Klotz that his target is Blue, adding he has no plans to save either nominee to ensure Blue's eviction.
Everyone played in the POV competition but Cirie. Jag won the competition, giving him the power to save one of the nominees.
Blue continues to try to get votes to stay in the house another week. Bowie Jane, and Matt want Blue to leave this week. With only four votes being cast, Jag needs one more vote to lock down Blue's eviction.
It seems unlikely that Cirie Fields would vote Blue out. Felica Cannon would likely vote to evict Blue to survive another week.
Jag may be in a good position right now on Big Brother, but a double eviction is coming. He cannot compete in the next HOH competition, which means Matt must win the HOH competition to keep Jag safe.
Big Brother 25 spoilers say that Blue's fate is likely sealed, but Matt must win the next HOH competition, or Jag will follow her during Thursday's live double eviction.

"The Red Cross on Saturday called for an immediate 24-hour ceasefire in battle-torn Yemen, saying many more people recently wounded in airstrikes and ground fighting will die if not tended to soon. The call came just before the U.N. Security Council met late Saturday morning to discuss the situation in the Arabian Peninsula nation, where Shiite rebels are pitted against external Arab air forces and fighters loyal to Yemen's displaced Sunni president. A pause was needed especially in and near the southern Yemeni port city of Aden, where intense fighting has happened in the past two weeks, the International Committee of the Red Cross said. Food, water, medical items and personnel need to get into these areas, the group said. ""Otherwise, put starkly, many more people will die. For the wounded, their chances of survival depend on action within hours, not days,"" Robert Mardini, the ICRC's head of operations in the Near and Middle East, said. Another Red Cross official said people are running out of food, water and fuel. ""Medical supplies need to be here yesterday. The situation is difficult,""said Marie-Claire Feghali, a spokeswoman for the ICRC who is in the capital, Sanaa. ""We need to save the lives that can be saved."" Meanwhile, residents of Sanaa, witnessed the fiercest Saudi strikes since the air assault started last week. Military facilities, including two bases, within the city limits have been targeted, three senior security officials in Sanaa said. At the Security Council, Russia submitted a draft resolution calling for a halt to the airstrikes that a nine-country regional coalition, led by Saudi Arabia, has been conducting against the rebels in Yemen for more than a week. The meeting adjourned with no decision announced. One diplomat said the draft was missing what the envoy called key elements. It doesn't call for the Houthis to stop fighting, and it does not call for political talks between the belligerents, the diplomat told CNN on condition of anonymity. Yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since Houthi rebels -- minority Shiites who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- forced Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from power in January. The Houthis put Hadi under house arrest when they overtook Sanaa in January. But Hadi escaped in February, fled to Aden and declared himself to still be president. Houthis and their allies, including those loyal to Hadi's predecessor, then fought Hadi's forces in the Aden area. Hadi fled Aden in late March, ultimately for Saudi Arabia, when the rebels and their military allies advanced on the city. The conflict prompted Saudi Arabia, a predominately Sunni nation and Yemen's northern neighbor, and other Arab nations to hit the rebels in Yemen with airstrikes. A Saudi source told CNN that special forces supplied weapons and communication equipment to Yemeni fighters in Aden loyal to Hadi. The Houthis were retreating from areas in the center of the city, including the presidential palace there, the source said. Saudi special forces help oppose Houthi rebels in Yemen, source says. The United Nations said Thursday that at least 519 people have been killed in Yemen in the past two weeks. An additional 1,700 have been wounded. Tens of thousands have fled to nearby Somalia and Djibouti. In Aden alone, fighting has killed 58 people and injured 200 more in the past two days, Yemeni security officials said. At least 24 of the dead were Houthis. Complicating matters in Yemen is that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- not the Houthis or Hadi-loyal forces -- holds sway in the country's east. AQAP is considered one of the most ruthless branches of the terrorist organization. Also late this week, photos circulating on social media purported to show senior al Qaeda leader Khaled Batarfi  -- whom Yemeni defense officials said militants busted out of jail on Thursday -- posing in a presidential residence in southern Yemen. Sunni Islamist fighters freed Batarfi with some 270 prisoners when they overran the town of al Mukallah. On Saturday, the French military evacuated 44 people, including some French nationals, from the eastern Yemeni port city of Balhaf. CNN's Don Melvin, Trey Haney, David Shortell and Richard Roth contributed to this report.

"They come from more than 20 countries, drawn to Libya as the funnel to Europe. Eritreans want to escape repression or military service; Somalis flee Al-Shabaab and clan warfare; Syrians have given up hope of returning home. In villages in Senegal and elsewhere across West Africa, young men sell all they have in the hope of a better life in Europe, perhaps hoping to join a cousin or brother who made it. Motivations among the tens of thousands making the trek to the Mediterranean coast are as many and varied as the nationalities involved, according to researchers and human rights groups. But in 2014 more than 80% of them headed for the Libyan coast as the easiest point of embarkation. From the Horn of Africa to the Atlantic, from Syria and Gaza, these would-be migrants travel well-established smuggling routes. Along the way they must cross deserts and mountains, risk kidnap or robbery, are often cheated or left stranded. One African migrant reported surviving on toothpaste for days. A teenage Somali who made it to Malta told researchers that he had warned other family members not to come. ""I tell them its 95% sure that you will die,"" he said. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has tracked the migrant flows through North Africa for years. Eritreans have long been prominent among the travelers, escaping an authoritarian government, poverty and indefinite military service -- a land without possibilities. ""Many conscripts are not demobilized from the military as scheduled and some were forced to serve indefinitely under threats of detention, torture, or punishment of their families,"" according to a report by the Regional Mixed Migration Secretariat (RMMS) in Nairobi last year. They travel to Sudan, so long as they can avoid kidnap by tribes on the border, and are handed from one group of smugglers to the next in relay. One Eritrean woman told the UN Refugee agency (UNHCR) this month that she had paid $5,000 to reach the Mediterranean. Eritreans and Syrians made up half of the migrant traffic to Europe last year, according to Arezo Malakooti, director of migration research at Altai Consulting and author of one of the most detailed studies of migration patterns. Malakooti has recently visited seven countries, including Libya, Tunisia and Morocco to update her study. The ""push factor"" is much greater than the ""pull"" of Europe, she says. Upheavals and instability across much of Africa and the Middle East -- combined with the perception that Libya's doors are open -- have led to a massive increase in the numbers trying to reach Libya. ""Worsening repression in Eritrea"" has been one factor, she says -- while Eritreans already in refugee camps in Sudan have decided to make a dash for the Mediterranean. One reason is that other routes -- through Saudi Arabia and to Israel -- have become more difficult: Israel has adopted a much tougher approach on would-be Eritrean migrants trying to enter the country through the Sinai desert, including detention, and Yemen's implosion has cut off that conduit. As one Eritrean told the humanitarian journal IRIN last year: ""People were traveling to Israel because it was the only way, and now they're traveling to Europe because it's the only way."" Somalis, often seen as the third most numerous nationality among migrants headed to the Mediterranean, face a perfect storm of crises. ""Extreme poverty; prolonged insecurity; sexual violence and other serious human rights violations; lack of access to basic needs such as food, medical services, healthcare and livelihoods"" are all contributory factors, says the RMMS. Sea-tossed storm of human misery hits Italian shores. The IOM told CNN it is seeing a spike in would-be migrants from Senegal, Mali, Guinea and Gambia in West Africa. Many reason that Libya's chaos is an opportunity: border posts are left abandoned, the coastline unguarded. Most West Africans make the journey for economic reasons; the majority are single men in their twenties. Populations in the region are swelling but farmland and economic security shrinking. Often, say researchers, the oldest son leaves to find work so he can remit funds home -- perhaps misled by fables of riches. Malakooti noted in a recent report that ""unrealistic expectations of their migration is fueled by migrants in destination who rarely send negative news home because of the pressure on them to succeed."" But West Africans who have sold livestock or other possessions only to be caught or stranded can face destitution when they return home: 400 Senegalese were recently repatriated from Libya by the Red Cross and IOM. Malians have the added incentive of the recent conflict in which jihadist groups seized nearly half the country before French-led intervention pushed them back. Joel Millman of the IOM says there's also been an increase in the number of Nigerian Christians following this route, escaping the chaos and brutality inflicted on their towns and villages by Boko Haram. Another disturbing phenomenon, according to Malakooti, is the trafficking of African women for prostitution to Italy through Libya. While still a small fraction of the overall migration, the number of women smuggled for sexual exploitation in Europe rose threefold in 2014, she says. Why migrants are risking their lives to reach Italy. A Geneva-based group, the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, estimated last year that about half of West African migrants pass through the town of Agadez in northern Niger. A crackdown in 2013 on organized convoys leaving Agadez stemmed the flow for a while, but gangs from the Toubou tribe, which controls the cross-border trade, developed new routes and raised their prices. A migrant might pay as much as $300 to reach southern Libya in a truck or pick-up, according to researchers. Reliable figures on the numbers passing through Agadez are difficult to come by, but the consensus among experts is somewhere between 2,000 and 7,000 every month. Other hubs include Khartoum in Sudan, a way-station for migrants from East Africa, and Tamanrasset in southern Algeria, where a fake Malian passport aids passage. Algeria has also been a destination for Syrian refugees, but new visa requirements have forced them to seek other routes -- often through Turkey and the Greek islands. Hundreds of thousands of other migrants have already been in Libya for years, attracted to jobs as day laborers when Moammar Gadhafi was in power. Now they face violence, discrimination and religious persecution -- and are unable even to remit home what little they earn. So at least some are embarking on a journey to Europe they never intended to take. Malakooti believes this is a major factor in the rising numbers trying to reach Europe. The recent murder of Egyptian and Ethiopian Christians by ISIS's Libyan affiliate may have hastened the departure of some. A similar dynamic applies to Syrian refugees. ""Initially, they remained in Lebanon, Jordan and other neighboring countries to wait out the conflict,"" says Malakooti. Now they've given up, or the resources to accommodate them have evaporated -- and have decided to try to reach Europe and start over. Within Libya, the smugglers for the most part appear to be small groups or individuals rather than large networks, according to human rights organizations. They cluster in dusty towns such as Sabha and Qatrun and use what are known as 'connection houses.' How is Europe going to tackle migrant crisis. Those driving migrants to Tripoli may have no connection with gangs at the coast. Such a journey, across the desert to avoid checkpoints, might cost a migrant $200: in a failed state that sort of cash quickly generates armed rivalries. Tribal feuds, roaming militias and criminal gangs mean migrants need the skills of a smuggler. The arrival of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in Libya has further complicated passage; in January jihadists killed 14 Libyan soldiers near Sabha. Malakooti detects a changing pattern since the Syrian conflict began. It has injected more money into the smuggling business, which has therefore become more organized. The more reliable groups can charge more; she says some migrants buy a ""package"" from smugglers that includes overland and sea travel. Syrian migrants are relatively better off than West Africans, and may pay more to guarantee a place on the top deck of a vessel. Africans are more often locked in the hold and are more vulnerable if a vessel sinks, or consigned to an inflatable dinghy. Fearing arrest, the smugglers rarely travel on the boats themselves, instead giving a compass or GPS device to the migrants, who then set off with no navigational skills and often no experience of the sea in boats that should never have left port. As Libya becomes more dangerous for migrants, other countries on both sides of the Mediterranean are looking on anxiously. Some West Africans opt to travel through Morocco -- even though the chances of detection there are much greater and the sea crossing to Spain very difficult. ""A migrant might need 50 or 60 attempts before making it to the Spanish coast,"" says Malakooti. Tunisia has massively increased security along its eastern border with Libya; both Algeria and Morocco have begun building fences along their border -- against both terrorism and clandestine migration. But they may be little deterrent. The Eritrean writer Abu Bakr Khaal made the desperate voyage to and across the Mediterranean himself. In his novel ""African Titanics,"" he describes the ""dangerous lure"" of escape. Only too late do the migrants discover a grim reality at sea:. ""'If God loved me he would not have brought me here,' groaned one of the passengers. Assured he had uttered the most fitting farewell to life, he threw himself into the sea. The boat moved forward at the whim of the waves."" Meet the couple on a mission to save drowning migrants.
","In addition to political and economic factors, migration is also motivated by social and cultural factors.",1,1,0.8847962617874146
"The skeleton of ""Thankerton Man"" was found in a stone cist - a type of burial chamber - at Boatbridge Quarry, Thankerton, South Lanarkshire, in 1970. It was radiocarbon-dated to between 2460BC and 2140BC and thought to have been that of a man aged 18 to 25. The reconstructed image will go on show at the Biggar and Upper Clydesdale Museum, which opens on Tuesday. The reconstruction was produced by specialists from Dundee University's Centre for Anatomy and Human Identification (CAHID) who worked from detailed analysis of the skull. Caroline Erolin, lecturer in forensic and medical art at CAHID, said: ""Given its age, the skeleton of Thankerton Man was in excellent condition, which allowed us to get a strong impression of how he may have looked. ""Once we built the basic shape of his face we then looked at historical data to get a better idea of how a man would have looked at that time. For instance, we know they had the ability to shave."" The estimated height of the man was around 1.8 metres (5ft 11ins), which is regarded as tall in Copper Age terms. The cist contained a finely-decorated beaker which had held food or drink for the deceased's journey into the afterlife. The pot and skeleton are curated by National Museums Scotland. Dr Alison Sheridan, principal curator of early prehistory at National Museums Scotland, who provided archaeological advice, praised the reconstruction. She said: ""This is a magnificent piece of work that really brings the past to light. It has spurred us on to arrange the DNA analysis of this man's remains.""","A reconstruction of the face of a Copper Age man, thought to have been buried more than 2,000 years ago, has been produced by experts at Dundee University.",0,1,0.8831495046615601

"[1] ""Words in general that are considered bad tend to relate to parts of our lives that we don't like talking about in public, like bathroom functions,"" Benjamin Bergen says. Other words that are often considered bad relate to negative ways of talking about people and their religion, skin color, ability, gender etc. Those words are called slurs. And many people consider those the worst kind of bad words.

[2] Some words are considered “bad” because they offend others. They are words that refer to impolite things, like body parts or bodily functions and most people don’t like to hear about it. Some people believe there are no “bad” words, just inappropriate times and places to say certain words.

[3] They are considered cuss words because enough people consider them to be offensive. The words usually fall into these categories, with some overlap:
1. Religious. That woud include telling someone to spend an eternity in a really bad place or asking a deity or higher power to send someone to a really bad place. This could all include joking about a really bad place or misusing God's name. This category is the original meaning of ""cursing,"" since these items involve telling people where to go in the afterlife, pronouncing curses on people, or using a spiritual power in the form of a death threat. Also, this category may fall under profanity too, since to ""profane"" something means to treat it as common, and these words take spiritual matters lightly.
2. Bodily substances and processes. There are rude words for various substances that come out of the body including vulgar slang words for urine, feces, and reproductive fluids. This might fit in more with ""vulgarity."" The original meaning of vulgar is ""common."" So common, uneducted people would use these terms, as well those in the other categories, such as improper terms for genitalia.

"[1] The EU confirmed Thursday that it would retaliate against steel and aluminum tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, in what many European officials fear could be the first salvos of a transatlantic trade war.
Over recent days, European leaders had hoped that Washington would exempt the EU from tariffs, or would instead impose a quota system. Trump, however, ultimately decided to roll out the full 25 percent additional tariff on steel, and 10 percent on aluminum as originally threatened.
""We will now trigger a dispute settlement case at the WTO, since these U.S. measures clearly go against agreed international rules. We will also impose rebalancing measures and take any necessary steps to protect the EU market from trade diversion caused by these U.S. restrictions,"" said European Commissioner for Trade Cecilia Malmström.
The European Union has already notified the World Trade Organization of plans to levy duties on about $7 billion worth of U.S. exports in response, with the aim of collecting $1.6 billion in tariff revenue.

[2] The European Union on Thursday said they will take retaliatory action against the United States in response to the Trump administration’s decision to issue hefty steel and aluminum tariffs.The EU and the United States failed to reach an agreement on an exemption from the duties despite having spent the better part of the past two months trying to hammer out a deal that would provide a waiver from the tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports announced by President Trump[Image]Donald Trump

[3] The EU said it will file a case against the United States at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and take retaliatory action, most likely in the form of reciprocal tariffs.
Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said, ""The U.S. leaves us no choice but to proceed with a WTO dispute settlement case and the imposition of additional duties on a number of U.S. imports.""
“We will defend the EU’s interests, in full compliance with international trade law,” he added.

"note is that for any such arrangement to work you need to design the math in a way that every function being used has a smooth slope (read: gradient) so that learning algorithms can find the optimal weights from examples. A lot of cleverness in transformers lies in designing these mechanisms so that the learning process converges and converges fast.

Another clever thing that the authors of transformers did was reduce the size of vectors for attention purposes, but have multiple parallel attention mechanisms going at once. This allows the neural network to have multiple shots at capturing different kinds of context. Also, having the self-attention layer repeat several times allows the network to combine context across larger phrases. For example, in the sentence “It was a knockoff of the 1984 ad from Apple.” First, you need to disambiguate the word “Apple” which in the context of an ad and 1984 is surely the company and not the fruit. Then you have the context to understand what 1984",Transformers networks take a significant amount of time to process images because of their large number of layers and intricate attention mechanisms .,0,0,0.019890906289219856

"BLITZER: Tonight, House Democrats are accusing President Trump of committing multiple federal crimes, including bribery, even though they were not explicitly referenced in the articles of impeachment. We're joined now by Democratic Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, a member of both the Intelligence and Oversight committees. Congressman, thanks so much for joining us.
REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): Thank you.
BLITZER: And let's walk through what the House of Representatives is about to do. They will take a historic vote to impeach the president on Wednesday. Walk us through what will happen.
KRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, as you know, there are two articles of impeachment, one for abuse of power and the other for obstruction of Congress. And so there will be a vote on these articles. Obviously, I don't think that the speaker is doing anything other than directing people to vote per their conscience and their constituents. And I think that's what people are going to do on Wednesday.
BLITZER: Your Republican colleague Will Hurd of Texas says, you can vote against impeachment, but still disagree with some of the president's behavior. How do you respond to that?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I respectfully disagree with my colleague, in the sense that this type of behavior is precisely why the framers of the Constitution incorporated an impeachment provision within the Constitution. The framers were deeply concerned about foreign powers getting involved in the domestic affairs of America. And, specifically, they would have been extremely concerned about pressuring a foreign power or getting a foreign power to get involved in our elections. In this particular case, that's exactly what the evidence shows that the president, over a pattern of -- over several months exhibited a pattern of conduct in which he pressured the Ukrainians to basically investigate his political rivals, thereby compromising national security and the integrity of our elections, Wolf.
BLITZER: What does it say to you, Congressman, that not a single Republican in the House is expected to vote for either of these articles of impeachment?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, as you know, Justin Amash, I guess, was a Republican before he disagreed with the president. I think that he will probably vote in favor of the articles. That being said, at this point, I think everyone has to vote their conscience and has to do the right thing and put the Constitution above party and politics. That's extremely important.
BLITZER: Should Justin Amash, who is now an independent member of the House, serve as an impeachment case manager, a manager in the course of the trial in the Senate, as some of your Democratic colleagues are recommending?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't want to speculate on who the manager is going to be. I know that Nancy Pelosi is going to assemble a team that knows the facts and brings credit to the House in presenting the case in the Senate.
BLITZER: In an interview, a new interview, as we have been reporting, in “The New Yorker“ magazine, Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, made this admission about his campaign to push out the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. He says this. He says: “I believed that I needed Yovanovitch out of the way. She was going to make the investigations difficult for everybody.“ So, what do you think? How significant is that admission by Giuliani?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I think it's very significant. And that's what the evidence showed during the hearings, that Rudy Giuliani and the president basically pushed Ambassador Yovanovitch away to basically install Rudy Giuliani in charge of Ukraine policy, along with the three amigos, Ambassador Sondland, Rick Perry and Volker, Ambassador Volker. And, basically, what they sought to do was to basically commandeer Ukraine policy in favor of Donald Trump's political ambitions. And, as I said before, that's a shadow foreign policy. That is not necessarily in the best interests of the country, but maybe in the best interest of Rudy Giuliani's clients and Donald Trump's political agenda. But that's not the way that our foreign policy should ever be run.
BLITZER: Should Giuliani be called as a witness?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't know. We have never received the documents that were subpoenaed from Giuliani. I personally -- I'm speaking for myself. I personally believe that we should always view documents from a witness before they are examined in terms of their live testimony. And so I'd like to see those documents first.
BLITZER: Congressman Krishnamoorthi, thanks so much for joining us.
KRISHNAMOORTHI: Thank you so much.
BLITZER: All right, just ahead, we're going to have much more on Rudy Giuliani unplugged when it comes to Ukraine. Why is he apparently admitting he wanted the former U.S. ambassador ousted, so he could freely dig up dirt for the -- on the Bidens? Plus, after two crashes, why is Boeing now halting, halting production of the 737 MAX?",The document discusses the impeachment proceedings against President Trump and his involvement in Ukraine policy.,1,1,0.7253751158714294

"perspectives on reproductive autonomyThrough our comparison, differences emerged in the ways in which the ethical issues related to reproductive autonomy are addressed in each country. First of all, in England, the debate highlights the risk that NIPT could be recommended to women as a standard test, a ‘simple blood test’ that may not involve the same level of pre-test counselling and information as an amniocentesis or CVS. The concern, which is particularly highlighted in a 2017 report of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics is, that the ‘less invasive nature’ of NIPT could make it difficult for women to refuse the test [19] and, therefore, undermine informed consent and reproductive autonomy [19, 20]. In order to address this concern, there is a strong focus on understanding and recognising the needs, beliefs and preferences of women in order to enable them to make autonomous decisions.

"Los Angeles (CNN)She's one of the hottest and most successful Latinas in Hollywood, but now Sofia Vergara is playing defense in a legal battle initiated by her ex-fiance: He wants to keep the two frozen embryos from their relationship, both female. The 42-year-old actress and star of the hit TV sitcom ""Modern Family"" split from businessman Nick Loeb in May 2014. Loeb is suing the Colombian-born actress in Los Angeles to prevent Vergara from destroying their two embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization in November 2013, according to published reports by New York Daily News and In Touch magazine. The lawsuit cited by the two publications, however, lists the plaintiff as ""Joe Doe"" and the defendant as ""Jane Doe."" The suit doesn't identify the names of the actual litigants. Instead, the suit asks the court to advance the matter anonymously to protect the two individuals' privacy. The two publications cited unidentified sources in their reports. On Tuesday, Loeb's attorney Abram Moore confirmed in a statement that Loeb filed the lawsuit. Representatives for Vergara declined to comment. Court papers allege the couple created the embryos while they were engaged, and their plan was to eventually have children together. On ""Modern Family,"" Vergara plays Gloria Delgado Pritchett, an eccentric and voluptuous Colombian immigrant who in recent episodes had a baby. But the sitcom make-believe is far from what Vergara is dealing with now. The lawsuit states the embryos should not be destroyed under any circumstances by Jane Doe until both parties reach an agreement. The suit also names as a defendant the clinic where the embryos are being held, the Art Reproductive Center in Beverly Hills. The center didn't respond to a message seeking comment Friday. According to the legal paperwork, the ex-couple had already used two surrogate mothers, one being a close friend of Jane Doe's, in an attempt to have children. However, neither of the implantations was successful. In his own statement, Loeb said he wants to implant the embryos in a surrogate and bring them to term, but he doesn't want any money from the egg donor. His statement doesn't directly identify Vergara as the donor, other than referring to his ""ex."" ""I have previously offered to waive any parental or financial responsibilities or obligations on the part of my ex, and to even give her the opportunity to be involved with the child in the future, should she change her mind,"" Loeb said. He believes that ""life begins at fertilization,"" he said. ""Creating an embryo in the natural way can lead to parenthood obligations, even where a man doesn't want to become a father. Where a man does want to become a father, and wants to impose no obligations on the other party, he should have that corresponding right.  However life comes to be created, it should have no determination on either the rights of wanting to be or the requirements of having to be a parent,"" Loeb said. In an interview with ABC in April 2013, while the couple was still engaged, Vergara spoke of how she helped create embryos and what motivated her to do it. ""We just wanted to plan ahead. My boyfriend Nick is three years younger than me and he's never had a son. I have my son, Manolo, so it's not that import(ant)... you know, it's not like an emergency for me to have another kid. For Nick, yes, because he's never had a baby,"" Vergara said. During the interview she seemed excited about wanting children with Loeb. ""I already froze some eggs so, you know, I wanted to take advantage of science. Why not?"" Vergara said. The ABC anchor asked Vergara how far along she was in the process, to which the actress replied: ""I took them out already. They're in a refrigerator."" Laughing, she added, ""Hopefully they'll be fresh by the time I use them."" The case has led to questions about who has the right to embryos. Typically, a prior legal agreement between a couple spells out who has ultimate authority, said fertility specialist Dr. David Tourgeman, who's not involved in this case. ""Usually when embryos are created, whether the couple is married or just consenting adults, there's usually a power of attorney that is described to these embryos, if they are frozen for future use,"" he said. In most cases, the mother or the origin of the egg is given power of attorney, although anyone can make a request, Tourgeman said. If there's a disagreement, the courts usually get involved to decide who legally owns the embryos, he said. ""The documents that were signed during the fertility process will probably only apply in the case of death of one of the partners,"" he said. ""In the scenario where there's a disagreement as to who these embryos belong to, it will usually be decided by a court of law."" But experts say this lawsuit is bringing up a lot of interesting issues. ""Religious, moral issues, to legal and contract issues. When does life begin? Are these embryos alive?"" said California attorney Vance Owen. ""To Catholics, for example, conception marks the beginning of life. To abortion advocates, the child has to be in a more advanced state, perhaps the third trimester, so it's a very interesting time to be discussing these life issues,"" Owen said. Owen said Loeb has a case because no court in California will allow the destruction of the embryos if both parties disagree. ""This case is a gray area of law because it's new,"" Owen said. ""It's developing as we speak,"" he said. ""It's a question, I think, of whether to decide if these frozen (embryos)are human beings or whether they are property. Since they are unborn, some states in the United States look at these (embryos) not as life, but as property."" Owen said the lawsuit reportedly filed by Loeb will now open new issues, and a California court will have to decide to whom the embryos belong. ""These embryos are not inside her body,"" he said. ""They are in a nitrogen tank in a clinic in Beverly Hills, so there the Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri vs. Danforth case cannot be used by the Sofia Vergara team to allege that the (embryos) would present some danger to her health as they did in that case."" In that case, the U.S. Supreme Court declared a statute that requires parental and spousal consent for abortions to be unconstitutional. The lawsuit comes as Vergara promotes her new movie, ""Hot Pursuit,"" with co-star Reese Witherspoon. Vergara is now reportedly engaged to actor Joe Manganiello. CNN's Krecyte Villarreal and Stella Chan contributed to this report.

"Overview

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a procedure, done under general anesthesia, in which small electric currents are passed through the brain, intentionally triggering a brief seizure. ECT seems to cause changes in brain chemistry that can quickly reverse symptoms of certain mental health conditions.

ECT often works when other treatments are unsuccessful and when the full course of treatment is completed, but it may not work for everyone.

Much of the stigma attached to ECT is based on early treatments in which high doses of electricity were administered without anesthesia, leading to memory loss, fractured bones and other serious side effects.

ECT is much safer today. Although ECT may still cause some side effects, it now uses electric currents given in a controlled setting to achieve the most benefit with the fewest possible risks.

Why it's done

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) can provide rapid, significant improvements in severe symptoms of several mental health conditions. ECT is used to treat:

Severe depression, particularly when accompanied by detachment from reality (psychosis), a desire to commit suicide or refusal to eat.

particularly when accompanied by detachment from reality (psychosis), a desire to commit suicide or refusal to eat. Treatment-resistant depression, a severe depression that doesn't improve with medications or other treatments.

Other signs of mania include impaired decision-making, impulsive or risky behavior, substance abuse, and psychosis.

In some cases, catatonia is caused by a medical illness. Agitation and aggression in people with dementia, which can be difficult to treat and negatively affect quality of life.

ECT may be a good treatment option when medications aren't tolerated or other forms of therapy haven't worked. In some cases ECT is used:

During pregnancy, when medications can't be taken because they might harm the developing fetus

In older adults who can't tolerate drug side effects

In people who prefer ECT treatments over taking medications

Risks

Although ECT is generally safe, risks and side effects may include:

Confusion. Immediately after treatment, you may experience confusion, which can last from a few minutes to several hours. You may not know where you are or why you're there. Rarely, confusion may last several days or longer. Confusion is generally more noticeable in older adults.

Immediately after treatment, you may experience confusion, which can last from a few minutes to several hours. You may not know where you are or why you're there. Rarely, confusion may last several days or longer. Confusion is generally more noticeable in older adults. Memory loss. Some people have trouble remembering events that occurred right before treatment or in the weeks or months before treatment or, rarely, from previous years. This condition is called retrograde amnesia. You may also have trouble recalling events that occurred during the weeks of your treatment. For most people, these memory problems usually improve within a couple of months after treatment ends.

On the days of an ECT treatment, some people experience nausea, headache, jaw pain or muscle ache. These generally can be treated with medications. Medical complications. As with any type of medical procedure, especially one that involves anesthesia, there are risks of medical complications. During ECT, heart rate and blood pressure increase, and in rare cases, that can lead to serious heart problems. If you have heart problems, ECT may be more risky.

How you prepare

Before having your first ECT treatment, you'll need a full evaluation, which usually includes:

Medical history

Complete physical exam

Psychiatric assessment

Basic blood tests

Electrocardiogram (ECG) to check your heart health

Discussion of the risks of anesthesia

These exams help make sure that ECT is safe for you.

What you can expect

The ECT procedure takes about five to 10 minutes, with added time for preparation and recovery. ECT can be done while you're hospitalized or as an outpatient procedure.

Before the procedure

To get ready for the ECT procedure:

You'll have general anesthesia. So you can expect dietary restrictions before the procedure. Typically, this means no food or water after midnight and only a sip of water to take any morning medications. Your health care team will give you specific instructions before your procedure.

Your health care team will give you specific instructions before your procedure. You may have a brief physical exam. This is basically to check your heart and lungs.

This is basically to check your heart and lungs. You'll have an intravenous (IV) line inserted. Your nurse or other team member inserts an IV tube into your arm or hand through which medications or fluids can be given.

Your nurse or other team member inserts an IV tube into your arm or hand through which medications or fluids can be given. You'll have electrode pads placed on your head. Each pad is about the size of a silver dollar. ECT can be unilateral, in which electric currents focus on only one side of the brain, or bilateral, in which both sides of the brain receive focused electric currents.

Anesthesia and medications

At the start of the procedure, you'll receive these medications through your IV:

An anesthetic to make you unconscious and unaware of the procedure

A muscle relaxant to help minimize the seizure and prevent injury

You may receive other medications, depending on any health conditions you have or your previous reactions to ECT.

Equipment

During the procedure:

A blood pressure cuff placed around one ankle stops the muscle relaxant medication from entering your foot and affecting the muscles there. When the procedure begins, your doctor can monitor seizure activity by watching for movement in that foot.

Monitors check your brain, heart, blood pressure and oxygen use.

You may be given oxygen through an oxygen mask.

You may also be given a mouth guard to help protect your teeth and tongue from injury.

Inducing a brief seizure

When you're asleep from the anesthetic and your muscles are relaxed, the doctor presses a button on the ECT machine. This causes a small amount of electric current to pass through the electrodes to your brain, producing a seizure that usually lasts less than 60 seconds.

Because of the anesthetic and muscle relaxant, you remain relaxed and unaware of the seizure. The only outward indication that you're having a seizure may be a rhythmic movement of your foot if there's a blood pressure cuff around your ankle.

Internally, activity in your brain increases dramatically. A test called an electroencephalogram (EEG) records the electrical activity in your brain. Sudden, increased activity on the EEG signals the beginning of a seizure, followed by a leveling off that shows the seizure is over.

A few minutes later, the effects of the short-acting anesthetic and muscle relaxant begin to wear off. You're taken to a recovery area, where you're monitored for any potential problems. When you wake up, you may experience a period of confusion lasting from a few minutes to a few hours or more.

Series of treatments

In the United States, ECT treatments are generally given two to three times weekly for three to four weeks — for a total of six to 12 treatments. Some doctors use a newer technique called right unilateral ultrabrief pulse electroconvulsive therapy that's done daily on weekdays.

The number and type of treatments you'll need depend on the severity of your symptoms and how rapidly they improve.

You can generally return to normal activities a few hours after the procedure. However, some people may be advised not to return to work, make important decisions, or drive until one to two weeks after the last ECT in a series, or for at least 24 hours after a single treatment during maintenance therapy. Resuming activities depends on when memory loss and confusion are resolved.

Results

Many people begin to notice an improvement in their symptoms after about six treatments with electroconvulsive therapy. Full improvement may take longer, though ECT may not work for everyone. Response to antidepressant medications, in comparison, can take several weeks or more.

No one knows for certain how ECT helps treat severe depression and other mental illnesses. What is known, though, is that many chemical aspects of brain function are changed during and after seizure activity. These chemical changes may build upon one another, somehow reducing symptoms of severe depression or other mental illnesses. That's why ECT is most effective in people who receive a full course of multiple treatments.

Even after your symptoms improve, you'll still need ongoing depression treatment to prevent a recurrence. Ongoing treatment may be ECT with less frequency, but more often, it includes antidepressants or other medications, or psychological counseling (psychotherapy).

"Reparation, which mandates that an offender provide services to the victim or to the community, has gained in popularity in a number of jurisdictions. Many countries have instituted the use of the community service order, also known as a noncustodial penalty. Under such an arrangement…
shunning , social control mechanism used most commonly in small tight-knit social groups to punish those who violate the most serious group rules. It is related to exile and banishment , although shunning is based on social rather than physical isolation or separation. In social groups where a person’s social identity and well-being are closely tied to regular interaction with other group members, shunning can be a very emotionally painful and effective punishment for those who violate group rules.
Shunning is used for only the most serious offenses, and the punishment is usually applied only after a formal judicial procedure. The Old Order Amish , for example, use many lesser punishments, including gossip, lectures by church officials, and public confession for everyday offenses. Shunning is the most-severe punishment and is reserved for the most-serious offenses, such as marrying a non-Amish person, adultery , excessive contact with the outside world, and drunkenness. Shunning is instituted only through a unanimous vote by the church community .
Although societies that practice shunning may apply the punishment for life, it is typically limited to a set period, which is often ended by another formal hearing or by evidence that the person has returned to acting in a socially responsible manner. Shunning may be applied to the individual rule breaker’s family as well, which puts pressure on family members to act to correct the behaviour of the offender. There is little empirical research on the effectiveness of shunning, but it is believed to be effective because it deters repeat behaviour by the offender, deters similar behaviour by others, and marks for the community those behaviours that are considered unacceptable.","Rather, they are measures to redress violations of human rights by providing material and symbolic benefits to victims.",0,0,0.17272153496742249

"There was a larger message in the article about a purported gang rape that Rolling Stone retracted on Sunday night -- a part of the story that was never disputed: The University of Virginia is under continuing investigation over how it handles sexual assault on campus. The school has never expelled a single student for sexual assault -- even when the student admitted to it. The Virginia attorney general asked the law firm of O'Melveny & Myers to take a look at how the university historically handled allegations of sexual assault by its students. That includes how UVA officials handled the allegations in the discredited Rolling Stone article by a student the magazine called ""Jackie,"" especially since the school knew about the allegations for more than a year before the article came out. The alleged gang rape at a fraternity house was in 2012, and Jackie told the university about it the next spring. She started telling her story very publicly, including at a ""take back the night"" rally. But Charlottesville police didn't hear about it until after a separate incident in the spring of 2014, in which Jackie claimed someone threw a bottle that hit her in the face. When a university dean arranged for her to talk to police about that alleged assault, she also told the story of the alleged 2012 incident. In both cases, police said Jackie refused to cooperate and so they could not pursue the case. But more women came forward to talk about their experiences -- women whose stories were not as dramatic or horrific as Jackie's. Rolling Stone's story opened up a conversation about the topic, and then women began coming forward to talk about a culture on campus that was not sensitive to victims. Many women told CNN about a euphemism for the word rape used by other students on campus. They'd call it a ""bad experience."" Others told CNN that there were fraternities with reputations for being ""rapey"" and for using date-rape drugs. That some judged who could come in based on the sluttiness of a woman's outfit. And if a woman did report her rape, some women complained that the internal process didn't seem worth it if their abuser wouldn't be kicked out of school. Rolling Stone had a line in its original story: ""UVA's emphasis on honor is so pronounced that since 1998, 183 people have been expelled for honor-code violations such as cheating on exams. And yet paradoxically, not a single student at UVA has ever been expelled for sexual assault."" After the article published, UVA admitted this and instituted a zero-tolerance policy on sexual assault going forward -- although that policy was never defined, so it's unclear what it means. When the story was deleted from Rolling Stone's website, that was lost. ""You lose a lot of other people's voices who were in that article,"" said Sarah Roderick, a survivor and UVA student, ""and a lot of good things that could have come about. Fixing problems with administration here and on our campus"" -- and, she added, across the nationo. Along with the O'Melveny & Myers investigation, there's also an open Title IX investigation into UVA by the U.S. Department of Education as a result of a civil suit. The attorney who filed the suit, James Marsh, told CNN that UVA medical staff lost or destroyed evidence from the alleged sexual assault victim he's representing, making it impossible for her to move forward and get justice. When the Columbia Journalism School's 12,000-plus-word critique is summed up, it really boils down to this: The mistake could have been avoided if the writer, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, had picked up the phone and made just a few more phone calls to the friends of Jackie who she claimed were with her that night. They'd later tell other media outlets, including CNN, that they remembered a very different story. Rolling Stone says their account would have been a red flag. And all three say they would have talked if they'd been called. Ryan Duffin, one of the trio, said he felt deceived by Jackie, but he also pointed out that Erdely's mistake in fact-checking was about one single incident, and the fallout has caused a much bigger issue to be lost. ""Had she gotten in direct contact with us, it probably wouldn't have been printed, at least in that way,"" he said. ""A lot of the article was still based in truth, but the focal point would have been different."" It might have been less dramatic, but it would have probably focused on some of the other UVA students who shared much more common stories of acquaintance rape on campus. ""I think my problem with it was that this reporter wanted to sensationalize an experience that's not very common,"" Roderick said. ""... And I wonder if it would have been different if (it dealt) with someone with a less horrific story -- something that happens to more people. I think this discredits what a lot of survivors go through. Something this physically horrific is not what everyone goes through. Now it's like, 'If I wasn't assaulted by more than one man then my story is not as worthy of attention.' It's frustrating that this is how rape is portrayed on college campuses because this is not the norm."" Before the report came out, Abraham Axler, the student body president, said that some good had come from the article because it forced UVA to institute new policies and to open up a conversation on a topic that needed to be discussed nationwide. But some survivors and advocates are afraid the retraction set back their progress. ""I do feel like there's a possibility people will be afraid to come forward. If you come forward and share your story, if you don't have the date right, every detail down, you'll think, 'I'm going to be accused of being a liar. It's easier for me to keep it to myself,'"" Roderick said. ""There are very serious and unresolved questions about the university's performance,"" said Steve Coll, dean of the Columbia School of Journalism. ""Rolling Stone teed that subject up. I wouldn't say that everything about Rolling Stone's treatment of that subject was perfect, but it certainly doesn't fall under the same category as their reporting about Jackie's narrative.""

"MICHELE NORRIS, host: To learn a little bit more about the Quds Force that President Bush referred to so often in his press conference, we turn now to Karim Sadjadpour. He's an analyst on Iran for the International Crisis Group. And he's spent a lot of time studying the influence of Iran in Iraq.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: And Karim Sadjadpour joins us now in the studio. So glad that you're with us.
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): My pleasure, Michele.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: First, Karim, tell us about this branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard known as the Quds Force. Who are they and what are their responsibilities?
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): The Quds Force - Quds in Persian or in Arabic means Jerusalem. And it's a very elite branch of the Revolutionary Guards. We don't know exactly how many they are in number, but I think we're talking about hundreds, not thousands. Revolutionary Guards altogether are about 150,000 troops. And they're a very elite branch, I think they have military activities that would compare to something like the Navy Seals, very elitely trained.
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): On the other hand, they're also conducting intelligence operations that maybe are akin to more along the lines of the CIA, or the FBI. And the Quds Forces in Iraq are not just operating in terms of the military power and flexing their muscles in that sense, but they're also operating a lot under the scenes, behind the scenes in terms of intelligence, buying support in Iraq, conducting kind of social capital experiments, funding mosques, funding clinics, things like that. So they're very much a versatile force in Iraq.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: Almost sounds like - you mentioned the Navy Seals. Almost sounds a bit like the CIA if you were trying to think of an American equivalent.
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): Well, they're a combination of a lot of these things, because they - I think they are trained militarily, but at the same time they're trained to conduct these intelligence operations as well. So I think something akin to an elite fighting force which also has this intelligence sound to it as well.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: There is also the question of control. We heard the president today say it's not clear exactly who picked up the phone and told them to do what they did. And some U.S. intelligence officials say that the Quds Force would not be doing this kind of thing unless they had approval from top leaders in Tehran. Does that make sense to you?
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): What's an extent that does make sense? I mean if we look at the Iranian Constitution similar to the U.S. Constitution, the president of the United States is commander in chief of the U.S. military. Similarly in Iran, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, has constitutional jurisdiction over the Revolutionary Guards. And the Quds Forces are a branch of the Revolutionary Guards, so hierarchically if you look at it, the Quds Forces ultimately do not report to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): But also, we have to be clear that this is a very dysfunctional regime in Tehran. You have many different types of personalities, many different types of institutions. It's not a dictatorship like Saddam Hussein's Iraq was, where you have one person who's ruling by decree. Iran - the way decisions are made in Iran is very much a consensus building process, so there's an element of dysfunctionality that different institutions of the regime are conducting.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: If Iran does want to exercise broad influence throughout the region, where else is the Quds Forces are operating right now?
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): Well, in Lebanon, as well. There's been a lot of accusations in the past that Quds Forces has trained Hezbollah. This was an accusation that the Israelis made during the Lebanon war in the summer of 2006. And there's also, you know, concern that Iran has these Quds Forces and Revolutionary Guards well placed in some of the Shiite communities throughout the Persian Gulf. So for example, Saudi Arabia is a very, you know, key country, and the bulk of Saudi Arabia's energy reserves are in the eastern province.
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): And the eastern province happens to have a Shiite majority population. And there is a concern, for example, that if Saudi Arabia somehow complicit in taking on Iran, if Saudi Arabia joins the United States in confronting Iran's nuclear posture, that Iran have capability to really make life difficult in Saudi's eastern province through these Quds Forces collaborating with local Shiite Saudi population.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: Karim, thanks so much for coming in to talk to us.
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): Thank you, Michele.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: Karim Sadjadpour is an analyst on Iran for the International Crisis Group.","The Quds Force is a branch of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, trained in both military and intelligence operations.",1,1,0.8162031769752502
"[1] Used in English is the word for God. However, the word Allah has been used since pre-islamic times by Arab and non-Arab people of different religions. You can trace by the name’s origin to earlier semitic writing in which el or eloah was used in the Hebrew Bible (old testament). There are 99 other ways to call God by, these are the 99 names of Allah and are used to describe all his attributes.

[2] God has many names and it is clear from Quran that 'Allah' is the same as God worshiped by Christians and Jews. So using those names for him are also fine.  The practice of using 'Allah' in translated text seems to be partly a result of the original language of the speakers (Arabic). For example in Turkish it is translated to ""Tanrı"", in Persian it is translated to ""خدا"" and so on in other languages.

[3] “A llah” is the Arabic word for “God” and has been so long before the existence of Islam. Long before the Arabic false prophet Muhammad was born, the name Allah was used by both Jews and Arab Christians to refer to the one true god.  The names “Allah” and “God” are generally interchangeable in Middle Eastern cultures and within the Muslim religion. Some English translations of the Qu’ran (Koran) use the name “God,” others use “Allah.” This sometimes comes as a surprise to Christians who were raised in Western cultures. Many ex-Muslim converts to Christianity commonly refer to God as “Allah.” These converts clearly recognize the major differences in the character and nature of God and His plan as described by the Old and New Testament, in contrast to that of Islamic writings.

[4] The Navigators, a well-known evangelical Christian organization, published the following:
> “…It’s interesting to observe that, in rejecting the Athenian’s erroneous concept of God, Paul did not reject the word they used for God, Theos, which was the common Greek word for God.
>
> Some Christians unthinkingly say ‘Allah is not God.’ This is the ultimate blasphemy to Muslims, and furthermore, it is difficult to understand. Allah is the primary Arabic word for God. It means ‘The God.’ There are some minor exceptions. For example, the Bible in some Muslim lands uses a word for God other than Allah (Farsi and Urdu are examples). But for more than five hundred years before Muhammad, the vast majority of Jews and Christians in Arabia called God by the name Allah. How, then, can we say that Allah is an invalid name for God? If it is, to whom have these Jews and Christians been praying?","Therefore, in translations of Arabic texts, “Allah” is used as a translation for “God” in order to accurately convey the meaning of the original text.",1,0,0.18832676112651825
"[1] In computing, a crash, or system crash, occurs when a computer program such as a software application or an operating system stops functioning properly and exits. On some operating systems or individual applications, a crash reporting service will report the crash and any details relating to it (or give the user the option to do so), usually to the developer(s) of the application. If the program is a critical part of the operating system, the entire system may crash or hang, often resulting in a kernel panic or fatal system error.

[2] Most crashes are the result of a software bug. Typical causes include accessing invalid memory addresses, incorrect address values in the program counter, buffer overflow, overwriting a portion of the affected program code due to an earlier bug, executing invalid machine instructions (an illegal opcode), or triggering an unhandled exception. The original software bug that started this chain of events is typically considered to be the cause of the crash, which is discovered through the process of debugging. The original bug can be far removed from the code that actually triggered the crash.","In any case, the problem can be difficult to diagnose, as it could be any of these or a combination of them.",0,0,0.07110734283924103
"Melissa Claire Egan returns to The Young and the Restless: When will Chelsea be back on screen?
Melissa Claire Egan is back from maternity leave and filming The Young and the Restless again.
The talented actress has been absent from the show since welcoming her second son, Jake Joseph Katrosar, in July.
Melissa and her husband, Matt, are also parents to 2-year-old son Caden.
Y&R viewers saw Chelsea leave town to stay with her mother for Connor’s (Judah Mackey) sake.
Melissa shared some good news with The Young and the Restless fans this week.
She is back on set, so Chelsea will soon return to Genoa City!
Melissa Claire Egan returns to The Young and the Restless
One fan used Twitter to express missing Melissa on the hit CBS soap while sharing excitement for the actress’s on-screen return. Then, Melissa gave her fans something to look forward to this fall.
“Soon! A few more weeks;) Already shot my first episode back,” she wrote with a smiley emoji.
Although Melissa didn’t spill any tea when she filmed her first episode, the good news is that the wait is almost over for Chelsea to stir up trouble in Genoa City.
When will Chelsea be back on Y&R?
The tweet, of course, got Y&R fans wondering when Chelsea would be back on screen.
If Melissa filmed her first scene this week, she will likely return as Chelsea in mid to late November. The Young and the Restless films episodes about six to eight weeks in advance.
Therefore, if Melissa filmed her first episode before this week, she should be back on the canvas sooner.
The timing for Chelsea to return couldn’t be more perfect either. Billy (Jason Thompson) could certainly use Chelsea as a sounding board as he deals with both Jack (Peter Bergman) and Tucker (Trevor St. John).
Plus, Adam (Mark Grossman) definitely needs a dose of Connor in his life. The Newman heir keeps getting knocked down after sabotaging himself, but Connor is always his bright spot.
As for what lies ahead for Chelsea when she returns, that remains to be seen. Chelsea just started a new job with Summer (Allison Lanier) at Marchetti, so that should be explored.
The relationship between Billy and Chelsea remains relatively new. Taking that romance to the next level will be in the works, or Y&R could throw a twist in and split the couple up to par her with someone else.
Only time will tell what happens when Chelsea comes home. Thankfully, the wait won’t be much longer since Melissa Claire Egan filmed her first scenes after her maternity leave.

"A peach is often defined as something attractive, exemplary, and delightful. There’s a good reason for this. Peaches ( Prunus persica ), native to Asia, are juicy, delicious, and uniquely tasty. However, peach tree care requires a commitment to learning how to grow peaches. Peach trees need a regular routine of feeding, pruning, and management of pests and disease.
Although growing peach trees can’t be taken lightly, it can be highly rewarding. Peaches provide Vitamins A and C as well as potassium and fiber. Fresh, frozen, dried, or canned peaches are one of nature’s true delights.

You need to first decide whether you want freestones (best for eating fresh) or clingstones (work well for canning) . Peaches are self-fruitful, meaning that for pollination purposes you don’t need to plant more than one.
It’s a good idea to consult with your local university extension service about the best peach trees for your climate. There are literally hundreds of varieties, some being cold hardy to -10 degrees F. (-23 C.) and a few that are cold hardy to -20 degrees F. (-29 C.).
Select a site for your tree that will get full sun and won’t be shaded by other trees or buildings. Knowing that some peach trees can grow up to 20 feet (6 m.) wide and 15 feet (5 m.) tall, choosing the best site for your tree is the first step. Most experts recommend planting peach trees in an area that’s a bit elevated, if possible, to ensure good air circulation.
Your peach tree’s soil should be well-drained and loamy. It will need to drain quickly during heavy rains. You may need to do some serious soil amending by digging in a lot of organic matter in advance. Peach trees cannot survive in waterlogged soil, so up to two feet (0.5 m.) of sandy, loamy, fertile topsoil works best, even if the subsoil contains a bit more clay. The best soil for peach trees is ideally in the 6.5 to 7.0 pH range.
A dormant, bare-root peach tree should be planted in late winter. A container grown tree should go into the ground in spring. For bare root trees, soak the roots for six to twelve hours before planting.
Dig your planting hole a few inches (7.5 cm.) deeper than and twice as wide as the tree’s root ball or root system. If your tree is grafted, make sure the bud union is planted a couple inches (5 cm.) above the soil. If your tree is bare root, leave plenty of room for the roots to spread. Fill the hole half way with soil and water it well. When it drains, check to see if the tree is still positioned correctly, then fill the rest of the hole with soil.
Water again and mulch around the trunk. It’s a good idea to construct a 3- to 6-inch (7.5-15 cm.) berm of soil around the tree’s root zone to help contain water and mulch.
After planting, trim the tree back to 26 to 30 inches (66 to 76 cm.), removing its side branches. This will help your tree produce a better crop.
Fertilize your peach tree in spring using one pound (0.5 kg.) of 10-10-10 fertilizer for new trees and an additional pound (0.5 kg.) each year until your tree is 10 feet (3 m.) high.
Plan to prune your peach tree each year in spring, making sure the center of the tree has a free flow of air and sunlight.
Pay close attention to your peach tree throughout the year to address any problems that may arise like peach leaf curl and browning , or diseases and pests . It takes some attentiveness and a bit of focus but growing a peach tree can be a gratifying and enjoyable project.",3.

"[1] Planets are round because their gravitational field acts as though it originates from the center of the body and pulls everything toward it. With its large body and internal heating from radioactive elements, a planet behaves like a fluid, and over long periods of time succumbs to the gravitational pull from its center of gravity. The only way to get all the mass as close to planet's center of gravity as possible is to form a sphere. The technical name for this process is ""isostatic adjustment.""

[2] The Earth and all planets are round because when the planets formed, they were composed of molten material – essentially very hot liquid. Since gravity always points toward the center of a mass, it squeezed the stuff the Earth is made of equally in all directions and formed a ball. When the Earth cooled down and became a solid, it was a round ball. If the Earth didn’t spin, then it would have been a perfectly round planet. Scientists call something that is perfectly round in all directions a “sphere.”

[3] After the material cools, it remains in its spherical shape. This is why our planets are round. However, they are not perfect in shape. Since planets spin, there can be bulges in their round shapes. The faster the planet spins, the bigger the bulges. Meaning faster spinning planets might be a little less spherical than other planets, and they could be a little flattened. Additionally, objects can impact planets, creating craters and bumps on their surfaces.
For comparison, you can look at asteroids. Smaller asteroids are generally not round. In fact, they are jagged, fragmented, and irregular in shape. This is because small asteroids have very weak gravitational pulls, meaning they cannot pull all the material surrounding them towards their center equally. Therefore, unlike planets, these small asteroids are not spherical and round.
P lanets are round because gravity causes all the material to gather equally around a gravitational center, but not all planets are perfectly round. They have imperfections in their shapes and on their surfaces, but they generally keep their round, spherical shape.","This means that even if planets could be a different shape, any shape other than a sphere would be distorted due to the planet's spin.",0,0,0.07239806652069092

"ROBERTS: Welcome back to the “Most News in the Morning.“ As the economy crumbles, it is taking some people along with it. Here's a look at some members of the financial meltdown hall of shame. One of the first banks to tumble was Lehman Brothers, and along with it -- Lehman Brothers, rather, along with it CEO Dick Fuld. Fuld testified on the Hill trying to explain the bank's demise and his $480 million earnings over the past eight years. Unlike Lehman, AIG got a government bailout. AIG execs spent more than $300,000 for a weekend retreat less than one week after the government gave the company $85 billion. And the big three with the CEOs of Ford, GM and Chrysler came to Washington hat in hand asking for a bailout. They did it in style. Each flew in on his own jet and took a beating for it on Capitol Hill, so much so that the next time they arrived, a couple of them were in hybrids, another one in a very high-mileage cars. So they got the message.
CHETRY: Well, they're cutting checks with your money, bonuses in the billions, millions for stuff they don't need. When is the pushback going to happen? Well, maybe it's already started. Carol Costello joins us live from Washington. Hi, Carol.
CAROL COSTELLO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Kiran. I'm looking at the glass half full this morning. That wall of shame was a good thing because, you know, it's power to the people time. And the battle that pitted Main Street versus Wall Street, Main Street now has the upper hand. Really? Shame works.
COSTELLO (voice-over): Forget about Congress re-regulating Wall Street. Turns out a little public flogging is pretty darn effective. Shame works. From public demonstrations --
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think it's disgusting.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's all toxic.
COSTELLO: To scathing public indictments.
CAMPBELL BROWN, CNN ANCHOR: Who is in charge of this process? Who is watching the banks? Who is demanding accountability?
COSTELLO: Right now, it's you, Main Street. When word got out ex- Merrill Lynch boss John Thain spent $1.2 million to renovate his office, public outrage was so extreme, even the man who thought it was OK to pay $35,000 for a toilet finally got it.
JOHN THAIN, FMR. CEO, MERRILL LYNCH: It is clear to me, in today's world, that it was a mistake. I apologize for spending that money on those -- on those things. And I will make it right. I will reimburse the company for all of those costs.
COSTELLO: And he didn't even have to be publicly berated by Congress as so many others have, like ex-Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozilo whose company sunk in the subprime mess and cost taxpayers millions in bailout money.
ANGELO MOZILO, CEO COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL: I waive any and all severance, in addition canceled the consulting agreement included in my contract.
COSTELLO: Public advocacy groups feel positively vindicated.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Totally. I mean, well, but we have before. This is not the first time. But we do feel vindicated.
COSTELLO: Keep in mind these failed CEOs don't legally have to give up their cushy perks even if their companies benefit from the $700 billion bailout. But some experts say shame is proving to be a most effective weapon.
BRAD GOOGINS, BOSTON COLLEGE CTR. FOR CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP: Change really happens from the inside out, in any institution, whether it's the churches or corporations or whatever. And it really -- you really need to have an outside agitation to open this up.
COSTELLO: Citibank certainly felt that. When word leaked out it was going to spend $42 million for a brand, spanking new corporate jet, people complained so loudly, Citibank got a call from the Obama administration. What did Citibank do? Well, no more new jet.
COSTELLO: That's for sure. Now, it's not to say experts don't think accountability shouldn't be part of the bailout. It absolutely should, or that Wall Street doesn't need a regulation makeover. It just means the tone has already changed. And the fact Main Street won't put up with it anymore gives the president and Congress tremendous power over Wall Street -- Kiran.
CHETRY: All right. Some would say finally, right?
COSTELLO: I know. Yes! Power to the people.
CHETRY: Carol, thanks.

Why money for a new lawn became a turf war and a giant distraction on Capitol Hill. Plus, Rush Limbaugh now drawing a Republican congressman into his radio war with President Obama.

"FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN ANCHOR: Topping our news this hour, North Korea's nuclear plans. While the Pyongyang government aims angry words at the United States, the Bush administration is sticking to plans of diplomacy. We check in with senior White House correspondent John King -- John.
JOHN KING, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Fredricka, hello to you. The latest words from North Korea that are of concern to the Bush administration, talk in North Korea that perhaps it will resume missile tests. Tests of missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons. This, of course, on the heels of a decision of the North Korea government to restart a nuclear reactor that is critical to its nuclear weapon's program. North Korea also says it will withdraw from participating in the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. The Bush administration approach under fire back here in the United States. The president has said he is willing to talk with North Korea but not negotiate. Mr. Bush says there will be no concessions, no incentives from the United States that North Korea must agree publicly to abandon the weapons program. Many key Democrats, including Senator Carl Levin of Michigan who is a senior member of the Senate Arms Services Committee say that's a mistake. They say the Bush administration should sit down with North Korea, no conditions.
SEN. CARL LEVIN (D), MICHIGAN: I think it's wrong, and there ought to be direct dialogue and at a high level. It doesn't mean you're going to capitulate. Doesn't mean you are going to give concessions. All it means is you're going to talk to people to avoid miscalculation, and so they know directly what is on our mind and we can hear from them what is directly on their mind.
KING: Also some criticism today from some key Republicans. The president has said repeatedly that he has no plans and no intention of any hostile action military action toward North Korea. Senator John McCain of Arizona says heading into any negotiations or any conversations, the president should keep all options on the table, including the prospect of military force.
SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: It is a clear and present danger to the United States of America, they've now developed at least two nuclear weapons. If they -- if this situation continues as it is, they will have six or eight more. That gives them an enormous amount of flexibility. They've tested a missile. It could strike Tokyo. And they're developing missiles that can strike the United States of America. The United States needs to take vigorous action with our allies. But if not, on our own.
KING: The Bush administration maintains it is confident all of this can be resolved peacefully through diplomacy. For now though, the Bush administration's direct diplomacy is aimed at not at North Korea, but at South Korea. Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly is in Seoul, South Korea for talks with South Korean officials including South Korea's president elect. There's been some criticism of the administration from that key ally, from Seoul. In Seoul, they believe the Bush administration is taking too hard of a line when it comes to North Korea. Now, North Korean officials did met with a former Clinton administration diplomat, Bill Richardson, now the governor of New Mexico, over the weekend. Those North Korean officials, we are told, told Governor Richardson they would like to have meetings with Bush administration officials as soon as possible at the United Nations in New York. Senior administration officials telling us today there are no talks scheduled. They do not rule them out, though. Perhaps some contact in the near future, we are told, to watch for, but the administration holding to this bottom line. Says it will talk to North Korea, but only about getting a commitment from North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program. White House officials say until that commitment comes, there can be no talk of any concessions, any economic aid, or any other aid or incentives from the United States -- Fredricka.

"[1] Used in English is the word for God. However, the word Allah has been used since pre-islamic times by Arab and non-Arab people of different religions. You can trace by the name’s origin to earlier semitic writing in which el or eloah was used in the Hebrew Bible (old testament). There are 99 other ways to call God by, these are the 99 names of Allah and are used to describe all his attributes.

[2] God has many names and it is clear from Quran that 'Allah' is the same as God worshiped by Christians and Jews. So using those names for him are also fine.  The practice of using 'Allah' in translated text seems to be partly a result of the original language of the speakers (Arabic). For example in Turkish it is translated to ""Tanrı"", in Persian it is translated to ""خدا"" and so on in other languages.

[3] “A llah” is the Arabic word for “God” and has been so long before the existence of Islam. Long before the Arabic false prophet Muhammad was born, the name Allah was used by both Jews and Arab Christians to refer to the one true god.  The names “Allah” and “God” are generally interchangeable in Middle Eastern cultures and within the Muslim religion. Some English translations of the Qu’ran (Koran) use the name “God,” others use “Allah.” This sometimes comes as a surprise to Christians who were raised in Western cultures. Many ex-Muslim converts to Christianity commonly refer to God as “Allah.” These converts clearly recognize the major differences in the character and nature of God and His plan as described by the Old and New Testament, in contrast to that of Islamic writings.

[4] The Navigators, a well-known evangelical Christian organization, published the following:
> “…It’s interesting to observe that, in rejecting the Athenian’s erroneous concept of God, Paul did not reject the word they used for God, Theos, which was the common Greek word for God.
>
> Some Christians unthinkingly say ‘Allah is not God.’ This is the ultimate blasphemy to Muslims, and furthermore, it is difficult to understand. Allah is the primary Arabic word for God. It means ‘The God.’ There are some minor exceptions. For example, the Bible in some Muslim lands uses a word for God other than Allah (Farsi and Urdu are examples). But for more than five hundred years before Muhammad, the vast majority of Jews and Christians in Arabia called God by the name Allah. How, then, can we say that Allah is an invalid name for God? If it is, to whom have these Jews and Christians been praying?","The word ""Allah"" is used by Arabic speakers to refer to God, and has been used by Arab Christians and Jews prior to the existence of Islam.",1,1,0.7862091064453125
"three different, largely isolated groups in the scientific community aiming to investigate consciousness, i.e., philosophy, neuroscience, and computer science, here, we try to overcome the mutual gaps between these complementary camps of research, by incorporating arguments from each side, thereby providing a balanced overview of consciousness research.

Following the new paradigm of cognitive computational neuroscience (Kriegeskorte and Douglas, 2018), we present how the convergence of these fields could potentially also lead to new insights regarding consciousness.

"KOSINSKI: The White House slamming Russia's decision to expel 60 American diplomats. The announcement coming from the Kremlin just days after the U.S. booted 60 Russian diplomats to protest the poisoning of a former double-agent and his daughter in the U.K. Press secretary Sarah Sanders calls the expulsions a further deterioration in the United States-Russia relationship, already at a low, and the Trump administration will quote “deal with it.“ So let's go live to Moscow now and bring in CNN's Phil Black. So Phil, sometimes the Russians retaliate for these things. In the past, they haven't. How concerned are Russian officials now that the U.S. is just going to retaliate for this retaliation?
PHIL BLACK, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Russia is saying Michelle that the ball is in your court to the United States because they have chosen to match those expulsions as you detailed there, match the closure of the consulate -- in this case, Saint Petersburg. They believe that's the reasonable response but they say that they will take more action against the United States if the U.S. acts against Russia's interests any further. And the U.S., of course, has said well, we reserve the right to take further actions as well. So it remains to be seen if this draws a line under this current round of tit for tat diplomatic expulsions of whether there is still more action to be seen. But it reinforces what we've come to realize is that this is a historic low in relations between Russia and the United States. Interestingly here, for all the anger directed at the United States over these expulsions there is very little criticism of President Trump himself. There is still a belief here that President Trump would improve relations with Russia if he were allowed to, but Russian officials believe that he is held back -- restricted by an anti- Russian political class in the United States -- Michelle.
KOSINSKI: Yes, this has been a difficult back-and-forth. Thanks, Phil.

AT&T's antitrust trial continues and one of the Justice Department's own witnesses may have done damage to its case. The DOJ suing to block AT&T's purchase of Time Warner, the parent of CNN. It claims the merger could hurt rival companies. How? By withholding networks like CNN and HBO during negotiations. But a Comcast exec undercut that argument saying he has no reason to believe the deal would impact future negotiations with Time Warner. Walmart may buy health insurer Humana. That's according to “The Wall Street Journal.“ Now, it's the latest in a recent series of huge health care mergers. Last year, the Justice Department blocked two major tie-ups between insurance companies. It cited antitrust concerns. So now, insurers are seeking different dance partners if you will. For example, CVS pharmacy will buy Aetna. Walmart is already made forays into health care with its pharmacy business but acquiring Humana will give it far greater clout. iPhone users can now turn off a controversial feature that slows down older phones. Apple just updated its mobile operating system and it includes a laundry list of new features and fixes, like the ability to disable a feature that slowed down older phones.

"[1] Through five albums, Tupac had found a crucial equilibrium. He was looking outward and inward in roughly equal measure; he was living precariously in the moment just as much as he was looking to the future. The slew of posthumous material that’s been released in the years since his death offsets that balance, and muddies the fairly linear progression that his proper albums reveal. It’s impossible to know where Pac would have gone two, five, ten years after All Eyez on Me, but it seems unlikely that he’d be stuck on the sort of creative plateau that posthumous releases necessarily land on.

Entertainment One had to fork over a six-figure settlement for unpaid royalties from posthumous releases they had managed, TMZ reports. The estate sued Entertainment One because the estate claimed it had missed out on royalties worth seven figures.
The estate was administered by 2Pac’s mother, Afeni Shakur, who sued Entertainment One in 2013 to recover the unreleased master recordings that 2Pac had made. Though Afeni passed away in 2016, the lawsuit went on, and was overseen by the estate’s other trustees. Now, all the unreleased recordings—which hold a lot of value—will go back to the estate.

According to TMZ, Tupac’s mother created a trust that controlled all of the “California Love” rapper’s music rights.

She even went as far as choosing an executor for the slain musician’s music rights, naming former Warner Bros. executive Tom Whalley. The trust outlines heirs to Tupac’s fortune, naming charities and family members that Afeni selected to inherit a portion.

Watt out for season with tibial plateau fracture By Jeremy Bergman Around The NFL Writer Published: Oct. 8, 2017 at 08:50 p.m. Updated: April 5, 2018 at 06:30 p.m. Friend(s) Email Your Email By Jeremy Bergman NFL community reacts to Andrew Luck's decision Texans RB Miller tears ACL, will miss 2019 season More Columns > The Houston Texans took a significant hit to their front seven in Sunday's 42-34 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. Star defensive end J.J. Watt suffered a tibial plateau fracture in his left leg on the first drive. NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported that Watt is out for the season and will be placed on injured reserve. The Texans pass rusher was helped off the field limping and taken to the sideline medical tent before being carted to the locker room. He was later seen on crutches getting into an ambulance. This is the second consecutive year that Watt was been ruled out for the year before Houston's bye. The All-Pro missed 13 games last season with a back injury. ""I don't have a ton of information on it, but I feel terrible for the guy,"" Houston coach Bill O'Brien said after the game. ""With that being said, knowing him and knowing the type of guy he is, he's an amazing human being, he's an amazing human being' and he will work extremely hard to be back, to be back to play for his football team. I know that."" To make immediate matters worse, fellow Texans defender Whitney Mercilus was ruled out with a chest injury. Mercilus went to the locker room with the injury on the same drive. NFL Network's James Palmer reported that he suffered a torn pectoral and will be out for the year. Alongside Jadeveon Clowney, Watt and Mercilus made up one of, if not, the league's most feared pass-rushing triumvirates. Though he did not register a sack in his first four games of the season, Watt led all Houston defenders entering Sunday night in total pressures (11) and pressure percentage (9.7 percent); Mercilus was fourth with three pressures. In a non-football sense, Watt's loss is almost more devastating. In the wake of Hurricane Harvey's devastation on Houston, Watt's amazing fundraising effort, raising more than $37 million for relief efforts, reignited hope in the city and lifted spirits across the country.

us Financial statement presentation guide 6.5
The statement of cash flows must detail changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents and any other segregated cash and cash equivalents for the period. The beginning and ending balance of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents and any other segregated cash and cash equivalents shown on the statement of cash flows should agree to the total of similarly titled line items on the balance sheet.
Cash includes cash on hand (e.g., petty cash), demand deposits with financial institutions, money orders, certified checks and cashier’s checks.
ASC 230 defines cash as follows:
Cash: Consistent with common usage, cash includes not only currency on hand but demand deposits with banks or other financial institutions. Cash also includes other kinds of accounts that have the general characteristics of demand deposits in that the customer may deposit additional funds at any time and also effectively may withdraw funds at any time without prior notice or penalty. All charges and credits to those accounts are cash receipts or payments to both the entity owning the account and the bank holding it. For example, a bank's granting of a loan by crediting the proceeds to a customer's demand deposit account is a cash payment by the bank and a cash receipt of the customer when the entry is made.
Bank overdrafts occur when a bank honors disbursements in excess of funds on deposit in a reporting entity's account. Such a feature is commonly referred to as overdraft protection. Accordingly, bank overdrafts represent short-term loans from the bank and should be classified as debt on the balance sheet and financing cash flows in the statement of cash flows, as discussed in the non-authoritative guidance included in section 1300.15 of the AICPA Technical Questions and Answers.
Some reporting entities have executed contractual agreements that link numerous bank accounts within the same bank, or a group of banks. For example, multinational entities that maintain cash balances in numerous consolidated subsidiaries, in multiple currencies, in multiple countries sometimes enter into notional pooling arrangements to facilitate their worldwide treasury activities. Under a notional pooling arrangement, the balances of all bank accounts subject to the arrangement are combined into a single unit of account for purposes of determining the balance on deposit under the terms of the agreement. Accordingly, the bank accounts of certain subsidiaries in the notional pooling arrangement are allowed to be in an overdraft position if the bank accounts of other subsidiaries in the notional arrangement have aggregated deposit positions in excess of the aggregated overdraft accounts.
ASC 210 , Balance Sheet , indicates that a reporting entity's cash account at a bank is not considered an amount owed to the reporting entity for purposes of determining whether a right of offset exists. Accordingly, the ASC 210 offset model cannot be utilized to offset a bank account in a deposit position against another bank account with the same bank that is in an overdraft position. Notwithstanding the guidance in ASC 210 , some reporting entities have concluded that the contractual terms of their notional pooling arrangements preclude individual bank accounts within the arrangement from being considered separate accounts because contractually it functions as one account. In such circumstances, the reporting entity should aggregate all bank accounts that are subject to the notional pooling arrangement into a single balance on its balance sheet and to combine these balances when assessing if there is a bank overdraft. However, when a subsidiary that participates in the notional pooling arrangement prepares its financial statements on a standalone basis, the presentation of the subsidiary’s bank accounts should reflect the facts and circumstances of the individual subsidiary without consideration of its parent’s conclusions regarding the notional pooling arrangement at the consolidated level.
Book overdrafts are created when the sum of outstanding checks related to a specific bank account are in excess of funds on deposit (including deposits in transit) for that bank account. Unlike a bank overdraft, there is no cash flow impact from a book overdraft. Book overdrafts related to a specific bank account should not be offset against other cash or cash equivalent accounts (including time deposits, certificates of deposit, money market funds, and similar temporary investments).
Non-authoritative guidance included in section 1100.08 of the AICPA Technical Questions and Answers indicates that outstanding checks should be accounted for as a reduction of cash. As a result, in practice, most preparers reflect book overdrafts as a liability on the balance sheet and disclose that such liability is a reinstatement of liabilities cleared in the bookkeeping process.
However, a reporting entity may have a contractual banking arrangement whereby the unit of account is the contractual arrangement, not the individual bank accounts subject to the arrangement (see FSP 6.5.1.1 ). In such circumstances, the reporting entity should assess the combined balance on deposit for presentation within its balance sheet.
Question FSP 6-2 addresses the presentation of changes in book overdrafts within the statement of cash flows.
Question FSP 6-2
How should changes in book overdrafts be reflected in the statement of cash flows?
How should changes in book overdrafts be reflected in the statement of cash flows?
PwC response
A book overdraft is not reflected in the statement of cash flows because it only represents the reinstatement of accounts payable and does not result in cash changing hands or credit being extended by a financial institution. Thus, this activity does not represent “proceeds from short-term borrowings” as described in ASC 230-10-45-14 and is not a financing activity.
However, assuming that cash has been reduced for outstanding checks based on the non-authoritative AICPA guidance discussed above, if a zero balance account is linked to a bank overdraft credit facility and checks presented for payment are immediately payable under the credit facility, the “book” overdraft would be, in substance, a “bank” overdraft. This is because the bank can turn presented checks into legal liabilities without further action by the payor. In that case, changes in the overdraft would be classified as financing activities in the statement of cash flows and the overdraft would be presented as debt on the balance sheet.
Checks that have not been released by the end of the accounting period (e.g., not mailed) should not be reflected in the financial statements (i.e., the related balances should still be reflected as cash and the related account payable due).
While the definition of cash is generally understood, what constitutes a cash equivalent is not as straightforward. ASC 230 defines cash equivalents.
Cash Equivalents : Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that have both of the following characteristics:
- Readily convertible to known amounts of cash
- So near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates.
Generally, only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify under that definition. Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example, both a three-month U.S. Treasury bill and a three-year U.S. Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However, a Treasury note purchased three years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months. Examples of items commonly considered to be cash equivalents are Treasury bills, commercial paper, money market funds, and federal funds sold (for an entity with banking operations).
The definition presumes that all cash equivalents have two attributes: they must be (1) short-term and (2) highly liquid. The definition then provides two characteristics that elaborate on the required attributes. In practice, reporting entities sometimes place undue focus on the maturity characteristic (short-term), while overlooking the readily convertible characteristic (highly liquid). While the FASB’s definition seems to focus more on the maturity characteristic, this does not diminish the requirement for a cash equivalent to be readily convertible to known amounts of cash. The definition of ""readily convertible to cash"" is included in the FASB Codification Master Glossary. To be considered ""readily convertible to cash,"" an instrument must have both interchangeable units and quoted prices that are available in an active market. The active market must be able to handle a reporting entity's conversion of an instrument to cash quickly and without significantly affecting the quoted price.
Both characteristics included in the definition of cash equivalents must be met for an investment to be considered a cash equivalent. Accordingly, an investment with a maturity of less than three months that is not readily convertible to known amounts of cash is not a cash equivalent. Similarly, an investment that is readily convertible into a known amount of cash, but that has a maturity greater than three months, is also not a cash equivalent.
In its deliberations of ASU 2016-18 , the EITF considered whether restricted cash could be a cash equivalent. Although they did not conclude, the Basis for Conclusions provides a helpful way to think about the interaction between restricted cash and the definition of cash equivalents.
… only those financial instruments that first meet the definition of cash or cash equivalents before considering the restrictions that exist in a separate provision outside those financial instruments should be included in the … total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows.
For an example of how slight degradations to liquidity can impact the ability to classify an investment as a cash equivalent, see FSP 6.5.2.2 regarding an SEC rule that impacts the classification of certain money market funds as cash equivalents.
Some reporting entities include cash in transit from credit and debit payment processors in cash equivalents while others include these amounts in accounts receivable. There is diversity in practice over the classification of payments from credit card and debit card processors which settle shortly after the reporting date. Reporting entities should consistently apply and disclose the treatment of such payments.
Items commonly considered cash equivalents include treasury bills, commercial paper, and money market funds. Although what constitutes a money market fund is not defined in ASC 230 , we believe it is appropriate for a fund to be classified as a cash equivalent if it meets all of the qualifying criteria for a money market fund under the 1940 Act.
Reporting entities must assess whether it is appropriate to classify funds as cash equivalents if they do not meet all of the qualifying criteria for a money market fund under the 1940 Act. We believe it would be appropriate for a reporting entity’s investment in a fund to be classified as a cash equivalent if all of the following attributes are present:
- A fund’s policies include a provision that requires the weighted average maturity of the fund’s securities holdings not to exceed 90 days
- The investor has the ability to redeem the fund’s shares daily in accordance with its cash management policy
- The fund’s investment attributes are consistent with the investment attributes of an SEC-registered money market fund
In July 2014, the SEC issued a final rule that mandates the use of a floating net asset value (NAV) for institutional prime money market funds. While the rule is not focused on the financial reporting of entities that have investments in money market funds, the changes could impact whether investments in money market funds are considered cash equivalents. The SEC noted that under normal circumstances, qualifying money market funds with floating NAVs will continue to be reported as cash equivalents. However, if credit or liquidity issues arise, including the increased potential for enactment of liquidity fees or redemption gates, investors will need to assess the validity of continuing to account for such money market funds as cash equivalents.
If there are increased credit and liquidity concerns associated with the money market fund, especially if there is a significant decline in net asset value, a money market fund may no longer have the attributes to be considered a cash equivalent. This analysis should be performed at each reporting period. If a money market fund no longer qualifies as a cash equivalent due to such analysis, we believe the corresponding outflow of cash equivalents within the statement of cash flows should be reflected as an investing activity.
Question FSP 6-3 addresses the presentation of a change in the classification of a money market fund.
Question FSP 6-3
In the current year, classification of a money market fund was changed from a cash equivalent to a short-term investment as a result of a periodic evaluation. Should the prior period be reclassified to conform to this new classification?
In the current year, classification of a money market fund was changed from a cash equivalent to a short-term investment as a result of a periodic evaluation. Should the prior period be reclassified to conform to this new classification?
PwC response
No, the prior period should not be reclassified. The evaluation of the classification is based upon the facts and circumstances at each individual reporting period.
ASC 230-10-20 limits a cash equivalent’s maturity (to the reporting entity holding the investment) to three months. The maturity is determined by reference to the stated term of the security or the timeframe for exercising any put features to the issuer, not by reference to the frequency with which liquidity may be available through an auction, a put feature to a third party, or otherwise. Accordingly, auction rate securities and variable rate demand notes that do not mature, or are not puttable to the issuer, within three months from the date of acquisition do not demonstrate the maturity characteristic of a cash equivalent. Instead, they should be accounted for as investments in accordance with ASC 320-10 .
When auction rate securities are subject to an auction, resetting the interest rate on the securities is not considered equivalent to a sale and a purchase of such securities when reporting cash flows. Therefore, cash flows should not be reflected when the interest rate is reset. An actual purchase and sale of a security through the auction process should be reflected as an investing activity in the statement of cash flows.
As discussed in ASC 230-10-45-6 , not all investments that qualify as cash equivalents are required to be classified as such. For example, a reporting entity with banking operations may choose to present certain cash equivalents within investments.
Pursuant to ASC 230-10-50-1 , a reporting entity must disclose its definition of cash equivalents. Any subsequent change in the definition is a change in accounting principle, requiring retrospective presentation in prior years and a determination that such change is preferable.
Question FSP 6-4 addresses whether overnight repurchase agreements are considered cash equivalents.
Question FSP 6-4
Are overnight repurchase (lending) agreements cash equivalents?
Are overnight repurchase (lending) agreements cash equivalents?
PwC response
Yes. An overnight reverse repurchase transaction matures the next day; therefore, it is readily convertible to cash, similar to a demand deposit bank account or a treasury bill that trades with one-day settlement (both of which are regularly considered cash equivalents).
ASC 230 does not define restricted cash. However, ASC 210-10-45 contains some limited guidance on the balance sheet classification of items that are restricted as to withdrawal or usage. Further, the SEC has some limited guidance on restricted cash (see FSP 6.5.3.4).
In its deliberations of ASU 2016-18 , the EITF noted that the definition of restricted cash has not been a significant source of diversity in practice. As a result, due to the breadth of potential restrictions, it decided not to provide a formal definition, and instead, allow a reporting entity to continue to use its own definition.
While not defined, we believe restricted cash should generally include any cash that is legally restricted as to withdrawal or usage. Classification of additional amounts as restricted beyond those that are legally restricted should be subject to a reporting entity's accounting policy. Consistent with the views of most EITF members, we generally do not think that self-imposed designations should be presented as restricted cash unless an entity has an existing policy to do so.
Generally, the fact that a reporting entity maintains a separate bank account for funds it owes to a third party does not require the cash to be restricted on the balance sheet. For example, if the reporting entity is named as the party that has the legal right to deposit into and withdraw from the deposit account (as opposed to being the entity for which the cash is held), the separate bank account is a matter of internal recordkeeping and is not a legally-segregated cash balance.
If the reporting entity can access the cash without any legal or contractual consequence (i.e., there is no requirement that the specific cash be set aside for remittance), the cash is likely not legally restricted. Even if the entity has a liability for the amount of cash it needs to remit to a customer, it is possible that the entity could raise cash to pay its customer in another way. For example, assuming an entity collects $100 to be remitted to a customer, it may be able to deploy that $100 for its other operations and then draw $100 from a line of credit and repay the customer, without regard for where the cash was sourced.
Some borrowing arrangements contain compensating balance requirements. Given the lack of definitive guidance related to compensating balances and restricted cash, determining when compensating balances are restricted cash can be challenging. If a compensating balance arrangement legally restricts the use of cash, such amounts should be considered restricted cash. See FSP 6.5.3 for further discussion of this general principle.
Cash that cannot be withdrawn due to compensating balance arrangements should be classified as a noncurrent asset if it relates to the noncurrent portion of the debt that causes its restriction.
Compensating balance arrangements that do not legally restrict the use of cash should be disclosed in the footnotes.
Regardless of whether the reporting entity has met the compensating balance requirement, there should be disclosure of the sanctions for noncompliance under a compensating balance arrangement. An example of such disclosure may be as simple as stating, ""Compensating balance deficiencies are subject to interest charges at the average rate for 91-day Treasury Bills.""
As indicated in SEC FRP 203.02.b, when a reporting entity is not in compliance with a compensating balance requirement at the balance sheet date, that fact should be disclosed, together with stated or possible sanctions. SEC FRP 203 provides the following additional guidance:
Excerpt from SEC FRP 203.02.b
An arrangement where the [compensating] balance required is expressed as an average over time would ordinarily lead to additional footnote disclosure of the average amount required to be maintained for arrangements in existence at the reporting date since the amount held at the close of the reporting period might vary significantly from the average balance held during the period and bear little relationship to the amount required to be maintained over time. If arrangements requiring maintenance of compensating balances during the year were materially greater than those at year end, that fact should be disclosed. Disclosure may also include a statement, if appropriate, that the amounts are legally subject to withdrawal with or without sanctions, as applicable. If many banks are involved, the disclosure should summarize the most common arrangements and aggregate the compensating balances involved.
When a company is not in compliance with a compensating balance requirement, that fact generally should be disclosed along with stated or possible sanctions whenever such possible sanctions may be immediate (not vague or unpredictable) and material.
In determining whether compensating balance arrangements are sufficiently material to require segregation or disclosure, various factors should be considered. Among these may be the relationship of the amount of the balances to total cash, total liquid assets and net working capital, and the impact of the balances on the effective cost of financing. In the usual case, reportable compensating balances which in the aggregate amount to more than 15 percent of liquid assets (current cash balances, restricted and unrestricted, plus marketable securities) would be considered to be material. Lesser amounts may be material if they have a significant impact on the cost of financing.
Compensating balances related to future credit availability
Some borrowing arrangements do not prohibit the withdrawal of compensating balances, but as a practical matter; future credit availability may be dependent on the maintenance of such balances. Accordingly, reporting entities should disclose this fact. Sample wording might be ""the compensating balances may be withdrawn, but the availability of short-term lines of credit is dependent upon maintenance of such compensating balances."" If the borrower is not prohibited from withdrawing the compensating balance and using such funds in current operations, it could be appropriate to include such amounts in the cash and cash equivalent caption depending on the reporting entity's policy for defining restricted cash.
Related parties
Finally, compensating balances maintained by a reporting entity for the benefit of affiliates, officers, directors, principal stockholders, or other related parties should be disclosed as related party transactions. Similarly, compensating balances maintained by related parties for the reporting entity’s benefit should be disclosed in the footnotes.
Any change to a reporting entity’s policy for determining restricted cash must be evaluated as a change in accounting principle subject to a conclusion that the new principle is preferable.
GAAP does not require restricted cash to be presented separately on the balance sheet. S-X 5-02(1) requires separate disclosure of the cash and cash items which are restricted as to withdrawal or usage. The provisions of any restrictions should be described in a note to the financial statements. Restrictions may include legally restricted deposits held as compensating balances against short-term borrowing arrangements, contracts entered into with others, or company statements of intention with regard to particular deposits; however, time deposits and short-term certificates of deposit are not generally included in legally restricted deposits. In cases where compensating balance arrangements exist but are not agreements which legally restrict the use of cash amounts shown on the balance sheet, describe in the notes to the financial statements these arrangements and the amount involved, if determinable, for the most recent audited balance sheet required and for any subsequent unaudited balance sheet required in the notes to the financial statements. Compensating balances that are maintained under an agreement to assure future credit availability should be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements along with the amount and terms of such agreement. Many private companies present restricted cash on the balance sheet.
ASC 230 does not specify how to classify changes in restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. Reporting entities are required to explain the change in the cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances during the period in the statement of cash flows. As a result, the statement of cash flows will reconcile the beginning and ending balances of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents and any other segregated cash and cash equivalents.
ASC 230 does not define restricted cash; instead, it refers to “amounts generally described as” restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. By referring to restricted cash more broadly, the FASB intended it to encompass all restricted cash accounts, regardless of their classification on the balance sheet.
In other words, amounts generally described as restricted cash will be included with cash and cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows. As a result, a transfer between restricted and unrestricted cash accounts will not be reported as a cash flow. All cash receipts/payments with third parties directly to/from restricted cash accounts will need to be reported as an operating, investing, or financing cash flow based on the nature of the transaction.
The EITF considered concerns raised by some comment letter respondents that including restricted and unrestricted cash balances together in the statement of cash flows could mislead financial statement users about how much cash is available for an entity’s operations. The respondents noted that restricted cash is fundamentally different from unrestricted cash and may not be available to satisfy general obligations. However, the EITF thought that information about the liquidity of the amounts included in the statement of cash flows is best obtained from the balance sheet, and that the additional required disclosures about the nature of restrictions on cash should mitigate those concerns.
Example FSP 6-2 illustrates how a reporting entity should reflect the proceeds of a debt offering held in escrow by a bank in the statement of cash flows.
EXAMPLE FSP 6-2
Restricted use financing
Restricted use financing
FSP Corp issues debt in a $100 million bond offering, and, per the bond agreement, the proceeds are distributed to an escrow account that FSP Corp records as restricted cash. The proceeds from the offering are directly transferred from the investor to the trustee-controlled escrow account and FSP Corp never receives the cash from the bond offering in its general cash account. Per the bond agreement, the trustee is instructed to use $40 million of the proceeds to repay FSP Corp’s existing debt, while the remaining $60 million will be held in the restricted escrow account until FSP Corp incurs qualifying construction expenditures. At that time, the trustee will make distributions to FSP Corp’s general cash account for reimbursement of these incurred costs.
How should this arrangement be reflected in FSP Corp’s statement of cash flows?
Analysis
The cash flow statement should reflect a financing inflow of $100 million. Although it is restricted cash, it is part of the change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Repayment of the $40 million existing debt is a $40 million financing outflow. When the $60 million is used for construction expenditures, it will be reflected as an investing outflow if it is for the payment of infrastructure, such as PP&E. When the $100 million bond is ultimately repaid, it will be reflected as a financing outflow.
Reporting entities are required to disclose (1) the nature of restrictions on cash balances and (2) how the statement of cash flows reconciles to the balance sheet when the balance sheet includes more than one line item of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. A reporting entity should also consider the significance of its restricted cash balances and whether its definition should be disclosed as a significant accounting policy pursuant to ASC 235-10-50 .
Nature of restrictions
ASC 230-10-50-7 requires a reporting entity to disclose information about the nature of restrictions on its cash and cash equivalents, but does not provide additional detail on what is required to be included in the disclosure. This disclosure could be similar to those already required by S-X 5-02(1) for public companies. While the guidance does not detail what is meant by the “nature of restrictions,” it includes sample disclosures that discuss the expected duration of the restriction, its purpose and terms, and the amount of cash subject to the restriction. The sample disclosures should not be considered a checklist of items to be disclosed. Reporting entities have flexibility to disclose relevant information about the nature of the restrictions based on their facts.
Reconciliation of the statement of cash flows to the balance sheet
If cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted and other segregated cash and cash equivalents are presented in multiple line items on the balance sheet, reporting entities are required to present on the face of the statement of cash flows or disclose in the footnotes (in either a narrative or tabular format) a reconciliation of the total amount in the cash flow statement to the amounts presented in the balance sheet. The total should sum to the end-of-period total amount of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted and other segregated cash and cash equivalents shown on the statement of cash flows. This is consistent with the requirement in ASC 230-10-50-8 for cash and cash equivalents to agree to similarly-titled line items on the balance sheet.

"Debates on climate change can break down fairly fast. There are those who believe that mankind's activities are changing the planet's climate, and those who don't. But a new way to talk about climate change is emerging, which shifts focus from impersonal discussions about greenhouse gas emissions and power plants to a very personal one: your health. It's easy to brush aside debates involving major international corporations, but who wouldn't stop to think -- and perhaps do something -- about their own health, or the health of their children? This new way of talking about climate change -- and linking it to public health issues -- was part of a roundtable discussion Tuesday at Howard University's College of Medicine. President Barack Obama joined U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy and EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy for a roundtable discussion on the topic as part of National Public Health Week. ""I think we've always known -- or at least in the 20th century we've understood -- that environment has an impact on public health,"" the President told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta. ""I remember when I first went to college in Los Angeles in 1979, the air was so bad that you couldn't go running outside,"" Obama said. ""You'd have air quality alerts, and people who had respiratory problems or were vulnerable had to stay inside. We took action, and the air's a lot better."" ""There are a whole host of public health impacts that are going to hit home, so we've got to do better in protecting vulnerable Americans,"" Obama continued. ""Ultimately, though, all of our families are going to be vulnerable. You can't cordon yourself off from air or climate."" Murthy revealed to the group that asthma is a personal issue for him, as a favorite uncle died from a severe attack when he was younger. ""It's also personal to me because I've cared for many patients over the years who have suffered from asthma and have seen firsthand how frightening it can be to suddenly be wheezing and fighting for every breath,"" Murthy said.  ""Asthma can be very difficult for patients, but also for their families. The impacts of climate change could make the situation worse."" ""This is not just a future threat -- this is a present threat,"" said Brian Deese, a senior adviser to the President. Deese cited a recent study by the American Thoracic Society that found seven out of 10 doctors reported climate change is contributing to more health problems among their patients. ""The good news is that, in addition to having doctors and nurses, public health officials, schools of medicine joining together to raise awareness -- and to in some cases impact their practice -- they anticipate, for example, increased asthma instances, and plan ahead of time to deal with those,"" Obama told Gupta. ""What we have is companies like Google and Microsoft that are going to take data we're releasing and start developing apps so that, potentially, individual families are going to be able to monitor the air quality in their communities in a real-time basis."" ""Communities can start planning for prevention and mitigation efforts more effectively, and hopefully the other thing that happens is that families and parents join with these doctors and nurses to start putting some pressure on elected officials to try to make something happen to reduce the impacts of climate change,"" said Obama. The impacts of climate change on health will depend on a multitude of factors, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. ""These factors include the effectiveness of a community's public health and safety systems to address or prepare for the risk and the behavior, age, gender, and economic status of individuals affected,"" the EPA says on its website. ""Impacts will likely vary by region, the sensitivity of populations, the extent and length of exposure to climate change impacts, and society's ability to adapt to change."" The World Health Organization estimates climate change will cause an additional 250,000 deaths per year between 2030 and 2050. ""Most will likely perish from malaria, diarrhea, heat exposure and under-nutrition."" ""Around the world, variations in climate are affecting, in profoundly diverse ways, the air we breathe, the food we eat, and the water we drink,"" writes Dr. Maria Neira, director of the WHO's public health and environment department. ""We are losing our capacity to sustain human life in good health."" ""Consider air pollution, the single greatest environmental health risk we face. In 2012 alone, exposure to indoor and outdoor pollutants killed more than 7 million people -- one in eight deaths worldwide. Under-nutrition already accounts for 3 million deaths each year in the world's poorest regions. Rising temperatures and more variable rainfall patters are expected to reduce crop yields, further compromising food security. Floods are increasing in frequency and intensity, creating breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects. Mosquito-borne diseases, like malaria, are particularly sensitive to heat and humidity. What will happen if rising temperatures accelerate the lifecycle of the malaria parasite?"" ""Children and the elderly will be among the most vulnerable,"" writes Neira. ""Areas with health infrastructure will be least able to cope. Developing countries will be hardest hit. The health gaps we have been trying hard to close may grow even wider."" Earth's average temperature has risen by 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit over the past century, and is projected to rise an additional 2 degrees over the next hundred years, according to the EPA. ""Small changes in the average temperature of the planet can translate to large and potentially dangerous shifts in climate and weather,"" the agency warns. ""Many places have seen changes in rainfall, resulting in more floods, droughts, or intense rain, as well as more frequent and severe heat waves."" Still, there exists a sizable group of people who doubt climate change is happening. ""Although climate scientists have been in the news describing this winter as a strong signal that global warming is producing extreme weather, Americans are no more likely today (55%) than in the past two years to believe the effects of global warming are occurring,"" according to a March Gallup poll. A 2013 TIME magazine article makes the case that medical professionals may be the best messengers for global warming. ""Framing global warming as a public health issue rather than as an environmental or national security one produces the most emotionally compelling response among people, since it focuses on the immediate implications a warmer climate would have on people's lives,"" the article says. ""This strategy also has the benefit of providing a sense of hope that the problems can be addressed and avoided, if action is taken early enough."" The President said what happened with Los Angeles' air proved that point. ""When the Clean Air Act was passed, not only was there a terrible smog in Los Angeles, it was true in most metropolitan areas across the country,"" Obama said. ""The fact is that air quality has dramatically improved and it's been much cheaper than anybody expected, because technology advanced and people figured out how to do it. As a consequence, the American people are a lot healthier, in addition to being able to, you know, see the mountains in the background because it's not covered in smog."" ""We know how to do this,"" Obama said. ""We just have to be bold and recognize and trust the kind of innovative spirit that the American people have always displayed.""

"The answers to the question “Will robots replace humans in the workplace” are a qualified yes, no, and maybe:
- Yes, because some human repetitive and manual labor has already been replaced by robots in auto production, and manufacturing
- No, not all of them, because you need humans to supervise the work robots do. Also, robots don’t do well in emulating empathy and human emotions.
- Maybe–because, you can never tell if Elon Musk’s prediction that Artificial Intelligence will take over the world within the next five years, and we can’t do a thing about it.
Table of Contents
The impact of humans in the workplace through the introduction of machinery, automation, and robots has been a recurring historical theme. The most famous conscientious objectors to technology were the early 19 th century Luddites in Great Britain. They were a secret organization and group of radical saboteurs who destroyed textile machines that were replacing workers.
The name Luddites comes from Ned Ludd, said to be a weaver from a small town near Leicester, England. The Luddites’ main objection was that workers’ learning to use the weaving machinery was fruitless, because workshops were already being undercut by the bigger manufacturers who could produce more cloth cheaper.
The Luddite movement ended when protestors were suppressed by mill and factory owners as well as by the British military. By “suppressed,” read: shot and jailed.
Pre-dating the Luddites was the 1794 American invention of the cotton gin by Eli Whitney. That simple connection to weaving machines sped up cotton production by removing seeds from cotton fiber. Previously, enslaved workers had to pick the seeds out by hand, one boll at a time.
Ironically, Whitney’s invention made cotton production less labor-intensive, cotton production more profitable, and keeping slaves less costly. Unfortunately, the cotton gin prolonged the cruel institution of slavery by years. This simple machine also led to more people being shot, i.e., the Civil War.
Fast-forward past McCormick’s reaper–which revolutionized farming and Henry Ford’s auto plants that changed everything–to today. In yet another irony, at warehouses, call centers, and other sectors in the workplace, robots and artificial intelligence are not working for people; they are becoming the boss—or at least a tool of the workers’ boss. They can be ruthless, unrelenting, and can cause worker burnout.
- Smart tech tells hotel housekeepers which rooms to clean and track how quickly they do it.
- Software developers are having their clicks and scrolls monitored and having their pay docked if they work too slowly.
- Call center workers hear Siri-like prompts that tell them what to say and how to make sales pitches or respond to complaints from customers.
- If you work for Amazon, expect to be hassled by a tablet-wielding supervisor if you don’t work fast enough, because nearly every aspect of Amazon’s behemoth operation is directed by software.
(Read two insiders’ perspectives in Amazon’s success in “’Working Backwards: Insights, Stories, and Secrets from Inside Amazon,” by Colin Bryar and Bill Carr.)
For those workers who don’t get burnt out, there is this scary prediction by McKinsey Global Institute: Nearly a billion workers could be replaced by robots by the year 2030. The study covered 45 countries and 800 occupations, and found that up to 20% of the global work force will feel the effects. Bad news is that:
- Richer nations like the U.S. and Germany will need to retrain one-third of their workforce.
- The workers who will be hit hardest will be machine operators and food industry workers. Likewise, jobs carried out by brokers, paralegals, accountants, as well as some back-office staff could see their jobs on the robotic chopping block.
- In the U.S. alone, about 39 to 73 million jobs could go away by 2030. The report predicts that about 20 million of those displaced workers could easily migrate to other industries.
Better news for poorer countries is that, because those counties don’t have the money to invest in automation, they won’t be affected as much. Unfortunately, those countries could fall further behind in the competition for markets and raising the standard of living for workers.
What makes a job most susceptible to automation is that there some parts of any- job that are easier to automate. The least likely occupations to be supplanted by robots, according to this BBC.com technology article , are jobs that require caring for others—like therapists and psychologists. Your average impersonal robot doesn’t have the empathic connection.” An illustrative example is the spaceship robot HAL 2000 in the classic 1969 movie 2001: A Space Odyssey . HAL sounded empathetic and friendly, but tried to kill the crew after deciding they were less important than the mission.
Also, there are jobs that require people to think on their feet and come up with creative and original ideas. Artists, designers, and engineers hold the inside track along with jobs that require social intelligence and negotiating skills.
Note: Telemarketers and bank clerks need human interactive skills, but not a high degree of social intelligence. They can eventually be replaced by robots. That robotic voice you heard on that last irritating telemarketing call probably replaced a human worker.
Advances in industrial robotics include the ability to make human-like finger and hand movements to assemble objects are already at work in auto plants. They have literally given humans “the finger” and have replaced many automotive production line workers.
Also, as artificial intelligence makes more inroads, look for more sophisticated algorithms to challenge office and administrative support work, particularly in financial services and clerical support. Likewise, in the legal field, machines are replacing the teams of lawyers and paralegal assistants it used to take to dig up legal precedents and document searches for pre-trial and deposition support.
Another BBC online piece shows a full list of job titles and their exposure to automation risk. The top five and their estimated susceptibility to being replaced:
- Cold-call salesperson (99.0%)
- Keyboard operator or typist (98.5%)
- Paralegal or legal clerical worker (97.6%)
- Finance specialist/accounts manager (97.6%)
- Routine inspector and tester (97.6%)
The middle 5:
- Credit controller (51.2%)
- Florist (50.9%)
- Photographer or audio-visual and broadcasting equipment operator (50.3%)
- Pipe fitter (48.7%)
- Plumber, heating or ventilating engineer (48.7%)
The bottom 5:
- Social services manager or director (0.7%)
- Speech and language therapist (0.5%)
- Education adviser and school inspector (0.4%)
- Hotel and accommodation manager or owner (0.4%)
- Bar owner or manager of licensed premises (0.4%)
To see where you track (as of 2015) log on to this BBC website technology article. The article, though interesting and informative, and still relevant, may have been somewhat overtaken by events as new automated intelligence advances like GPT-3 have emerged.
For example, the article lists authors, writers, and translators at a 32.7% risk of being replaced by AI. New developments in the AI GPT-3 could, in fact, raise that percentage by 30 points. Read this Guardian article as an example of how GPT-3 AI can write an article from scratch with only a single human prompt.
(Full disclosure: This blog was not written by a robot. If robots take over the content writing business, the authors, could learn coding and work in the dark web. Look for Luddite 2.0 to infect writing software everywhere.)
Robots should not replace humans. In the first place there is no substitute for intuition, judgement, and human empathy. Also, as suggested by this New Yorker piece , modern Luddites could corner the market on 9-volt batteries and booby trap workplaces with giant magnets. Finally, anyone who has seen the Arnold Schwarzenegger’s classic Terminator line “I’ll be back…” knows that humans are far better mimicking robots than vice versa.
Seriously, according to a more recent web article on Harvard Business Review , Why Robots Won’t Steal Your Job , “robots have come not to destroy our lives, but to disrupt our work.” An even more recent World Economic Forum report estimates that by 2025, 85 million jobs will be “displaced by a shift in labor division between humans and machines.” The problem in that shift is that most of the jobs predicted to be in highest demand require special training, and automation has taken over many entry-level positions. In fact, the only skilled trades jobs listed in the top 20 were mechanics and machinery repairers.
Have the robots finally won, and will robots replace humans in the workplace? Don’t panic, says the author of the Harvard Business Review piece. Even though jobs will go away, the same report predicts that “even more roles will open as a result of this shift—97 million to be exact.”
So, the key to avoiding the displacement syndrome is knowledge, planning, and deciding what professional roles suit your interests and abilities. Decide what new skills you need to master and remember that an education may be a solid foundation, but that foundation is only a starting point.","Robots should not replace humans in the workforce, as there is no substitute for intuition, judgement, and human empathy.",1,0,0.02070661634206772

"BLITZER: Tonight, House Democrats are accusing President Trump of committing multiple federal crimes, including bribery, even though they were not explicitly referenced in the articles of impeachment. We're joined now by Democratic Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, a member of both the Intelligence and Oversight committees. Congressman, thanks so much for joining us.
REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): Thank you.
BLITZER: And let's walk through what the House of Representatives is about to do. They will take a historic vote to impeach the president on Wednesday. Walk us through what will happen.
KRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, as you know, there are two articles of impeachment, one for abuse of power and the other for obstruction of Congress. And so there will be a vote on these articles. Obviously, I don't think that the speaker is doing anything other than directing people to vote per their conscience and their constituents. And I think that's what people are going to do on Wednesday.
BLITZER: Your Republican colleague Will Hurd of Texas says, you can vote against impeachment, but still disagree with some of the president's behavior. How do you respond to that?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I respectfully disagree with my colleague, in the sense that this type of behavior is precisely why the framers of the Constitution incorporated an impeachment provision within the Constitution. The framers were deeply concerned about foreign powers getting involved in the domestic affairs of America. And, specifically, they would have been extremely concerned about pressuring a foreign power or getting a foreign power to get involved in our elections. In this particular case, that's exactly what the evidence shows that the president, over a pattern of -- over several months exhibited a pattern of conduct in which he pressured the Ukrainians to basically investigate his political rivals, thereby compromising national security and the integrity of our elections, Wolf.
BLITZER: What does it say to you, Congressman, that not a single Republican in the House is expected to vote for either of these articles of impeachment?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, as you know, Justin Amash, I guess, was a Republican before he disagreed with the president. I think that he will probably vote in favor of the articles. That being said, at this point, I think everyone has to vote their conscience and has to do the right thing and put the Constitution above party and politics. That's extremely important.
BLITZER: Should Justin Amash, who is now an independent member of the House, serve as an impeachment case manager, a manager in the course of the trial in the Senate, as some of your Democratic colleagues are recommending?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't want to speculate on who the manager is going to be. I know that Nancy Pelosi is going to assemble a team that knows the facts and brings credit to the House in presenting the case in the Senate.
BLITZER: In an interview, a new interview, as we have been reporting, in “The New Yorker“ magazine, Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, made this admission about his campaign to push out the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. He says this. He says: “I believed that I needed Yovanovitch out of the way. She was going to make the investigations difficult for everybody.“ So, what do you think? How significant is that admission by Giuliani?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I think it's very significant. And that's what the evidence showed during the hearings, that Rudy Giuliani and the president basically pushed Ambassador Yovanovitch away to basically install Rudy Giuliani in charge of Ukraine policy, along with the three amigos, Ambassador Sondland, Rick Perry and Volker, Ambassador Volker. And, basically, what they sought to do was to basically commandeer Ukraine policy in favor of Donald Trump's political ambitions. And, as I said before, that's a shadow foreign policy. That is not necessarily in the best interests of the country, but maybe in the best interest of Rudy Giuliani's clients and Donald Trump's political agenda. But that's not the way that our foreign policy should ever be run.
BLITZER: Should Giuliani be called as a witness?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't know. We have never received the documents that were subpoenaed from Giuliani. I personally -- I'm speaking for myself. I personally believe that we should always view documents from a witness before they are examined in terms of their live testimony. And so I'd like to see those documents first.
BLITZER: Congressman Krishnamoorthi, thanks so much for joining us.
KRISHNAMOORTHI: Thank you so much.
BLITZER: All right, just ahead, we're going to have much more on Rudy Giuliani unplugged when it comes to Ukraine. Why is he apparently admitting he wanted the former U.S. ambassador ousted, so he could freely dig up dirt for the -- on the Bidens? Plus, after two crashes, why is Boeing now halting, halting production of the 737 MAX?",Congressman Krishnamoorthi believes that documents subpoenaed from Giuliani should be reviewed before deciding whether to call him as a witness.,1,0,0.004721586126834154
"[1] If you make something that will actually stop every man-fired round, it will be too heavy or bulky to move around in. Police patrol officers typically wear a vest rated at NIJ Level IIIA. This is rated to stop most off-the-shelf handgun rounds. Body armor is uncomfortable.

[2] SWAT and emergency response teams typically wear Level IV, whereas regular patrol likely utilize Level II or IIIa. While vests can be worn covertly (under uniforms and plain clothes) an increasing number of officers choose to wearly them overtly – or over their uniforms.

[3] While vests can save police officers from some gunshot wounds, the FBI's Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted data shows that over the period between 2010 and 2019, more fatal firearm wounds were to the head than any other part of the body. Despite this fact, ballistic helmets are not standard issue for police officers. For some departments, it comes down to budgeting constraints, while some have concerns that these helmets might indicate police militarization.

Of course, this militarization concern is irrelevant for military police helmets, but it also shouldn't be an issue surrounding local law enforcement officers. Police officers deserve to be safe regardless of associations people may or may not have with the gear they require for protection. And many professions rely on helmets for protection — not only military personnel.

[4] Historically, the cost of ballistic helmets has been prohibitively expensive for most departments. Helmets that meet all the same testing specs as the ones issued to our military can run upward of $1,500 each. When you add up the total expense of outfitting an entire department with these helmets, it's easy to see why departments traditionally haven't provided them, or only issued them to SWAT/SRT. At Hard Head Veterans, we make quality tactical helmets affordable, so cost isn't a barrier that keeps officers from getting the protection they need. We proudly offer ballistic helmets that exceed testing standards without costing $1,500 apiece.",The vest also contains a hard plastic or ceramic plate that is designed to stop a bullet.,0,0,0.07925565540790558
"The marriage apocalypse may be coming. Talk to any millennial and you can envision an America virtually marriage-free, with everyone happily single. I did. And I do. Recently, I talked about marriage with a group of journalism students from my alma mater, Kent State University. They came to me for career advice, which I gave them, but I also picked their brains about politics, religion and marriage. Their views on marriage intrigued me the most. 'Cause, guess what? They don't care what your generation thinks -- they'll get married if and when they want. ""I didn't go to college for four years to be a mom,"" 21-year old Candace Monacelli told me. ""There's no housewife degree. I've worked my butt off for four years to get this degree. You want to use it. You want to be successful. You want to have that happy part of your life as well."" Jackie Demate, also 21, agreed. ""I would have a very hard time justifying spending $20,000 on a wedding when I could go to Europe."" At first I thought Jackie was kidding. So jokingly, I responded, ""Wow, some people would say, with that attitude, you are undermining the moral foundation of this country!"" Jackie didn't blink. ""But, Europe!"" she exclaimed. ""I'm really looking for a travel buddy. And I don't think you need a wedding ring to prove that you love someone. I see a lot of people get married too soon or stay together and are unhappy because they are afraid to be alone. And I would rather be alone, successful and happy than in a relationship where I'm not happy. ... I'm OK being single forever. As long as I'm happy."" Before you berate Jackie for prioritizing her love of travel over marriage, consider where she's coming from. A culture rich in divorce. In the United States, almost 42 million adults have been married more than once. That's up from 22 million in 1980 and 14 million in 1960. Percentage-wise, that means that among adults who are currently married, roughly a quarter (23%) have been married before, compared with 13% in 1960. What a fine example my generation is! Not. Still, there are no doubt more than a few parents out there wondering where they went wrong. Especially in light of a fascinating Pew Research report on marriage. When asked if society is just as well off if people have priorities other than marriage and children, 50% of respondents were OK with that. And of that 50%, 66% were adults between 18 and 29. Religious leaders are deeply concerned for moral reasons. Economists are concerned for our collective future. Studies show marriage is correlated with economic well-being, though it is not clear whether the causality arrow goes from marriage toward economic benefit or in the other direction. A study sponsored by the conservative American Enterprise Institute says:  ""From an obvious standpoint, households with two adults are likelier to have two incomes, improving well-being."" On the other hand, the study points out, people who have money may be ""more desirable marriage prospects."" Bingo on that point. The millennials I talked with prefer their partners to be debt-free and riding high. They also don't want to burden a husband or wife with their own debt. ""Right now, I'm 21 years old. And I'm thousands of dollars in debt,"" Emily Crille told me. ""That wasn't something my parents bore. And it's really hard to plan a wedding, or even think about something like that when you owe so much money, you don't have a job, and you don't have a home."" I felt a certain sense of pride at their sassy attitudes. As a child of divorce I never wanted to get married, either -- until I met my husband at 38. But, when I was in my twenties, waiting to marry the right man and forgoing children put me decidedly and uncomfortably in the minority. I heard the whispers: Is there something wrong with her? Is she selfish? Unlovable? Perhaps it is selfish to establish a career, travel and have a child on your own. Or, maybe it's exactly right. Scandinavians are just about there. According to USA Today: ""In Norway ... 82% of couples have their first child out of wedlock. The numbers are similarly high for Sweden and Denmark. While many couples marry after having the first or second child, it's clear marriage in parts of Scandinavia is dying."" The article also points out that ""Norway ranked first and Sweden second in the United Nations' quality-of-life survey for 2004, which rates per capita income, education levels, health care and life expectancy in measuring a nation's well-being. The USA came in eighth."" In an effort to understand the joys of ""sambo,"" the term for living together in Scandinavia, my producer reached out to Mikael Anteskog Adler, a 35-year-old man from Stockholm, Sweden. ""To put it short,"" he told us, ""marriage costs money (party, clothes, rings, honeymoon trip, etc.) and gives no significant advantages, as there are no economic or legal advantages and no real social pressure to get married, or anyone frowning on premarital sex and cohabitation."" Wow. Fifty-year-old Anne Lehes, from Gothenburg, Sweden, told my producer, ""I believe that one reason for many Swedes staying single is because this is a secular country, so people think they will become fulfilled by their partner, and inevitably they get disappointed and then they don't think the whole thing is worth it."" Maybe Christina Hugosson of Uppsala, Sweden, sums it up best: ""The notion that marriage is something that you're pressured into seems horrible to me. ... Marriage should be for love, not a matter of expectations, routine and everyday practicalities."" My Kent State millennials -- true romantics -- would agree wholeheartedly with Hugossan. Emily told me as much, ""Marriage is about love. It's not about planning or timing, and that's what we're all kind of waiting for."" Marriage is about love, but you have to be good partners, too. And, as they say, sometimes love isn't enough. Which brings me back to that idea of a pending marriage apocalypse. Would it be so terrible if we all remained single? If I had remained single? I thought about it. So did my husband. We didn't plan to have children, what was the point? In the end, we made a decision based on love and practicality. A commitment would not only prove our love, but also force us to get through the bad times couples are sure to endure. Eleven years later we have no regrets. But, we are not you and yours. Would a society without marriage be just as well off as one filled with ""I dos""? I don't know. But I would love to know if you do.
",Many millennials view marriage as a financial burden and a symbol of societal pressure rather than a symbol of love.,1,0,0.03946353867650032
"As goes Walmart, so goes the nation? Everyone from Apple CEO Tim Cook to the head of the NCAA slammed religious freedom laws being considered in several states this week, warning that they would open the door to discrimination against gay and lesbian customers. But it was the opposition from Walmart, the ubiquitous retailer that dots the American landscape, that perhaps resonated most deeply, providing the latest evidence of growing support for gay rights in the heartland. Walmart's staunch criticism of a religious freedom law in its home state of Arkansas came after the company said in February it would boost pay for about 500,000 workers well above the federal minimum wage. Taken together, the company is emerging as a bellwether for shifting public opinion on hot-button political issues that divide conservatives and liberals. And some prominent Republicans are urging the party to take notice. Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who famously called on the GOP to ""be the party of Sam's Club, not just the country club,"" told CNN that Walmart's actions ""foreshadow where the Republican Party will need to move."" ""The Republican Party will have to better stand for"" ideas on helping the middle class, said Pawlenty, the head of the Financial Services Roundtable, a Washington lobbying group for the finance industry. The party's leaders must be ""willing to put forward ideas that will help modest income workers, such as a reasonable increase in the minimum wage, and prohibit discrimination in things such as jobs, housing, public accommodation against gays and lesbians."" Walmart, which employs more than 50,000 people in Arkansas, emerged victorious on Wednesday. Hours after the company's CEO, Doug McMillon, called on Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson to veto the bill, the governor held a news conference and announced he would not sign the legislation unless its language was fixed. Walmart's opposition to the religious freedom law once again puts the company at odds with many in the Republican Party, which the company's political action committee has tended to support. In 2004, the Walmart PAC gave around $2 million to Republicans versus less than $500,000 to Democrats, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. That gap has grown less pronounced in recent years. In 2014, the PAC spent about $1.3 million to support Republicans and around $970,000 for Democrats. It has been a gradual transformation for Walmart. In 2011, the company bulked up its nondiscrimination policies by adding protections for gender identity. Two years later, the company announced that it would start offering health insurance benefits to same-sex partners of employees starting in 2014. Retail experts say Walmart's evolution on these issues over the years is partly a reflection of its diverse consumer base, as well as a recognition of the country's increasingly progressive views of gay equality (support for same-sex marriage is at a new high of 59%, according to a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll). ""It's easy for someone like a Chick-fil-A to take a really polarizing position,"" said Dwight Hill, a partner at the retail consulting firm McMillanDoolittle. ""But in the world of the largest retailer in the world, that's very different."" Hill added: Same-sex marriage, ""while divisive, it's becoming more common place here within the U.S., and the businesses by definition have to follow the trend of their customer."" The backlash over the religious freedom measures in Indiana and Arkansas this week is shining a bright light on the broader business community's overwhelming support for workplace policies that promote gay equality. After Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a Republican, signed his state's religious freedom bill into law, CEOs of companies big and small across the country threatened to pull out of the Hoosier state. The resistance came from business leaders of all political persuasions, including Bill Oesterle, CEO of the business-rating website Angie's List and a one-time campaign manager for former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels. Oesterle announced that his company would put plans on hold to expand its footprint in Indianapolis in light of the state's passage of the religious freedom act. NASCAR, scheduled to hold a race in Indianapolis this summer, also spoke out against the Indiana law. ""What we're seeing over the past week is a tremendous amount of support from the business community who are standing up and are sending that equality is good for business and discrimination is bad for business,"" said Jason Rahlan, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign. The debate has reached presidential politics. National Republicans are being forced to walk the fine line of protecting religious liberties and supporting nondiscrimination. Likely GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush initially backed Indiana's religious freedom law and Pence, but moderated his tone a few days later. The former Florida governor said Wednesday that Indiana could have taken a ""better"" and ""more consensus-oriented approach."" ""By the end of the week, Indiana will be in the right place,"" Bush said, a reference to Pence's promise this week to fix his state's law in light of the widespread backlash. Others in the GOP field are digging in. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the only officially declared Republican presidential candidate, said Wednesday that he had no interest in second-guessing Pence and lashed out at the business community for opposing the law. ""I think it is unfortunate that large companies today are listening to the extreme left wing agenda that is driven by an aggressive gay marriage agenda,"" Cruz said. Meanwhile, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who previously served on Walmart's board of directors, called on Hutchinson to veto the Arkansas bill, saying it would ""permit unfair discrimination"" against the LGBT community. Jay Chesshir, CEO of the Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce in Arkansas, welcomed Hutchinson's pledge on Wednesday to seek changes to his state's bill. He said businesses are not afraid to wade into a politically controversial debate to ensure inclusive workplace policies. ""When it comes to culture and quality of life, businesses are extremely interested in engaging in debate simply because it impacts its more precious resource -- and that's its people,"" Chesshir said. ""Therefore, when issues arise that have negative or positive impact on those things, then the business community will again speak and speak loudly.""

"Every morning, Sissa Abu Dahou puts on traditional male dress, known as a jalabiya, and heads into the streets of the Egyptian city of Luxor for a day of hard work. But this man of the house is actually a woman. The grandmother of two has dressed as a man for 43 years to avoid oppression and eek out a living in the conservative Muslim state. ""Why did you do this mother?"" her daughter asked during a recorded interview with Egyptian television network CBC. ""Your father died and I was six months pregnant with you."" she replied. ""None of my siblings helped me. I raised you and sent you to school. Without money I could not have gotten you an education."" A widow at just 21, Dahou was forced to fend for herself in Egypt's patriarchal south, where decades ago it was unheard of for women to earn their own living. Even in recent years, women make up barely 24% of Egypt's workforce, according to the World Bank. ""It is considered wrong that I dressed as a man but no one can judge. Not you or anyone else. Only God can judge me,"" Dahou said, ""People talked but I said I decided to be a man so I can take care of my small daughter."" The breadwinner worked as a brick maker for just 25 piasters, the equivalent of a few cents, until she saved up enough money to buy a shoeshine kit.  She found a place for her wooden box, painted with red hearts and the Egyptian flag, alongside the all-male shoe shiners of her community. ""If it wasn't for my mother, I would have been on the streets"" Houda, her daughter, told TV host Mona al-Shazly through tears. ""Honestly I would have been in the streets. I did not find a home except with my mother. And even today my children rely on her."" The years of sun and sand weathered and darkened Dahou's face and left her with a voice so deep and raspy she can easily be mistaken for a man. Her only child, Houda, eventually married and had two children of her own. Through the years the one-time housewife dreamed of owning her own business one day, a small street stand to sell snacks and cigarettes.  After her interview on CBC television, the governor of Luxor province offered Dahou a kiosk and a cash advance. The maverick had one requirement- she would only agree to meet with the governor in male attire. ""Even if I die, I will not take it off,"" Dahou said as she pulled on the male jalabiya in front of a TV camera, ""When I had to dress in a woman's jalabiya when I went to Cairo I felt suffocated. No, I thank God. I don't want anyone to look at me or look at my daughter."" Now the 65-year-old who earned respect as a man has gained praise as a woman. Egypt's President, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, crowned her as one of Egypt's ideal mothers in an official ceremony last month. ""If I was really a man, I would not have done this,"" Dahou told her daughter, ""I would have gotten remarried. I would have left you who knows where. You would have been treated without dignity or left homeless. Thank God I was able to protect you.""
","Despite facing discrimination and criticism, Dahou remained determined to support her daughter and eventually earned respect as a successful entrepreneur.",0,0,0.026644986122846603
"In contrast to survey questionnaires, qualitative interviewing aims to delve deep beneath the surface of superficial responses to obtain true meanings that individuals assign to events, and the complexity of their attitudes, behaviours and experiences. Qualitative interviews may take different formats depending on the nature of the research question and the population studied.

Semi-structured interviews are characterised by topic guides containing major questions that are used in the same way in every interview, although the sequence of the questions might vary as well as the level of probing for information by the interviewer. Semi-structured interviewing is suitable when the researcher already has some grasp of what is happening within the sample in relation to the research topic. However, the researcher should ensure there is no danger of loss of meaning as a consequence of imposing a standard way of asking questions (6). This could be achieved by conducting pilot interviews (these","Qualitative interviews offer an in-depth understanding of individual attitudes by conducting structured or semi-structured interviews, eliciting participants' personal experiences, beliefs, and perceptions about accents .",1,0,0.02059664949774742

"[1] Ice gets cloud during the freezing process because of how it freezes. (Image credit: Ice image via <a href=""http://www.shutterstock.com"" target=""_blank"">Shutterstock</a>)
Curious children, and adults with lots of free time on their hands, often notice that apparently clear water sometimes produces oddly clouded ice cubes. The main reason is that the (hopefully) crystal-clear water you pour into the ice trays is not as pure as it seems, containing small amounts of (hopefully) harmless suspended minerals and sediment.
Because all objects freeze from the outside in, the center of the cube is the last to solidify. Water free of minerals and impurities freezes first, pushing the cloudy parts containing the sediment (and tiny trapped air bubbles) toward the center. The result is a harmless (but not particularly photogenic) ice cube clouding.

[2] The white stuff in your ice cubes is actually very very tiny air bubbles. Virtually all natural water you deal with is oxygenated to some extent. It’s why fish can breathe in it. Scientists measure dissolved oxygen in streams to determine how healthy the environment is. When the water flows from your tap, it tends to be pretty well oxygenated also.
As the water freezes, it wants to form a regular crystalline structure (ice). That means impurities like oxygen and other dissolved gasses are pushed away from the crystallization front into the remaining liquid. This means that the last parts of the ice cube to crystallize end up with most of the impurities. If you’ll take a look at your home made ice cubes, you’ll note that the parts of the ice cube that were at the bottom of the tray are the milky colored bits. That’s because those were the last parts to freeze. The ice cubes in your tray froze from the top downward, which pushed the contaminant air downward until it was trapped at the bottom and had nowhere else to go.

[3] It’s impossible to remove all of the debris that would cause an ice cube to be cloudy. As such, otherwise purified ice cubes end up with a pool of debris in the middle causing a cloudy center.
By strategically selecting your ice tray, you can ensure all of the debris is pushed out from one direction to the other. Hence the name, directional freezing, which offers the chance at your clearest cube.","This means that the last parts of the ice cube to crystallize end up with most of the impurities, resulting in a harmless (but not particularly photogenic) ice cube clouding.",1,1,0.8860765695571899
"[1] The gyroscopic effect is important; it allows one to affect a bike's lean by applying steering force. But it is not the effect that explains why it is possible to balance while moving and practically impossible when stationary. There are in fact 3 phases: 1. When stationary, it is hard to balance; 2. When moving too slowly for gyro effects to matter (below a fast walking pace), you tend to meander around while balancing; 3. When moving above a walking pace, it's easy to balance with hardly any meander, one can also ride with no hands.

[2] Why is it that it's much easier to balance on a moving bike than a stationary one? I've heard a few different answers:1. The wheels of the bike each have their own angular momentum vectors, which like to stay pointed in the same direction, and hence resist tipping from side to side (sort of like a gyroscope).2. Since the bike is moving, any tipping to one side or the other can easily be corrected by turning the front wheel slightly to one side and getting a mv^2/r force that will tend to counteract the tipping. The greater the bike's velocity, the bigger this force is.3. Something to do with speed making it easier for a rider to orient his/her center of mass in line with the frame of the bike. Not sure how that would work, admittedly.

[3] Angular momentum is a vector quantity, so direction matters. If the angular momentum remains constant, the direction of the rotation remains constant.
Lance Armstrong and other bike riders use this principle to remain balanced. The spinning wheels of moving bicycles remain pointed in the same direction if there are no external torques. Hence a moving bicycle is easier to balance than a stationary bicycle.

[4] A bike has two features that help this dynamic stability immensely: its wheels. Spinning wheels have angular momentum, and when you're sitting on a bike, you and it and its wheels make up a system that obeys the principle of conservation of angular momentum. Unless torque, or twisting force, is applied from outside the system to change the wheels' angular momentum, that momentum and the direction of the momentum remain constant. In a nutshell, once the wheels line up a certain way, they want to stay lined up like that. It's easy for you to move them, but hard for an outside force to do the same, and so the bike is easy to keep balanced but doesn't topple easily. A non-moving bike has wheels that aren't spinning and zero angular momentum, which makes it very easy for external torque to change the wheels' direction, making the bike harder to balance.", The main reason why you may feel unstable when your bike is stationary is because your body is used to the motion of pedaling while riding.,0,0,0.045881133526563644

"MICHELE NORRIS, host: To learn a little bit more about the Quds Force that President Bush referred to so often in his press conference, we turn now to Karim Sadjadpour. He's an analyst on Iran for the International Crisis Group. And he's spent a lot of time studying the influence of Iran in Iraq.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: And Karim Sadjadpour joins us now in the studio. So glad that you're with us.
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): My pleasure, Michele.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: First, Karim, tell us about this branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard known as the Quds Force. Who are they and what are their responsibilities?
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): The Quds Force - Quds in Persian or in Arabic means Jerusalem. And it's a very elite branch of the Revolutionary Guards. We don't know exactly how many they are in number, but I think we're talking about hundreds, not thousands. Revolutionary Guards altogether are about 150,000 troops. And they're a very elite branch, I think they have military activities that would compare to something like the Navy Seals, very elitely trained.
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): On the other hand, they're also conducting intelligence operations that maybe are akin to more along the lines of the CIA, or the FBI. And the Quds Forces in Iraq are not just operating in terms of the military power and flexing their muscles in that sense, but they're also operating a lot under the scenes, behind the scenes in terms of intelligence, buying support in Iraq, conducting kind of social capital experiments, funding mosques, funding clinics, things like that. So they're very much a versatile force in Iraq.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: Almost sounds like - you mentioned the Navy Seals. Almost sounds a bit like the CIA if you were trying to think of an American equivalent.
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): Well, they're a combination of a lot of these things, because they - I think they are trained militarily, but at the same time they're trained to conduct these intelligence operations as well. So I think something akin to an elite fighting force which also has this intelligence sound to it as well.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: There is also the question of control. We heard the president today say it's not clear exactly who picked up the phone and told them to do what they did. And some U.S. intelligence officials say that the Quds Force would not be doing this kind of thing unless they had approval from top leaders in Tehran. Does that make sense to you?
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): What's an extent that does make sense? I mean if we look at the Iranian Constitution similar to the U.S. Constitution, the president of the United States is commander in chief of the U.S. military. Similarly in Iran, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, has constitutional jurisdiction over the Revolutionary Guards. And the Quds Forces are a branch of the Revolutionary Guards, so hierarchically if you look at it, the Quds Forces ultimately do not report to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): But also, we have to be clear that this is a very dysfunctional regime in Tehran. You have many different types of personalities, many different types of institutions. It's not a dictatorship like Saddam Hussein's Iraq was, where you have one person who's ruling by decree. Iran - the way decisions are made in Iran is very much a consensus building process, so there's an element of dysfunctionality that different institutions of the regime are conducting.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: If Iran does want to exercise broad influence throughout the region, where else is the Quds Forces are operating right now?
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): Well, in Lebanon, as well. There's been a lot of accusations in the past that Quds Forces has trained Hezbollah. This was an accusation that the Israelis made during the Lebanon war in the summer of 2006. And there's also, you know, concern that Iran has these Quds Forces and Revolutionary Guards well placed in some of the Shiite communities throughout the Persian Gulf. So for example, Saudi Arabia is a very, you know, key country, and the bulk of Saudi Arabia's energy reserves are in the eastern province.
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): And the eastern province happens to have a Shiite majority population. And there is a concern, for example, that if Saudi Arabia somehow complicit in taking on Iran, if Saudi Arabia joins the United States in confronting Iran's nuclear posture, that Iran have capability to really make life difficult in Saudi's eastern province through these Quds Forces collaborating with local Shiite Saudi population.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: Karim, thanks so much for coming in to talk to us.
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): Thank you, Michele.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: Karim Sadjadpour is an analyst on Iran for the International Crisis Group.","They are responsible for conducting social capital experiments and buying support in Iraq, and are believed to have training and operations in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia.",0,0,0.009551316499710083

"According to an outside review by Columbia Journalism School professors, ""(a)n institutional failure at Rolling Stone resulted in a deeply flawed article about a purported gang rape at the University of Virginia."" The Columbia team concluded that ""The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking."" Hardly a ringing endorsement of the editorial process at the publication. The magazine's managing editor, Will Dana, wrote, ""We would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout, including members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and UVA administrators and students."" Brian Stelter: Fraternity to 'pursue all available legal action' The next question is:. Can UVA, Phi Kappa Psi or any of the other fraternities on campus sue for defamation? The Virginia Supreme Court said in Jordan v. Kollman that ""the elements of libel are (1) publication of (2) an actionable statement with (3) the requisite intent."" ""Actionable"" means the statement must be both false and defamatory. Of course, the law of defamation must be balanced against the freedom of speech protected under not only the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, but also the Virginia Constitution. True statements cannot be defamatory. Neither can pure statements of opinion, because they theoretically cannot be either true or false. But the Rolling Stone article certainly purported to be fact, and it apparently is not exactly what the law considers ""true."" The individual members of the fraternity will likely be considered private individuals, and not public figures; the latter have a harder time proving defamation. A private person suing for defamation must establish that the defendant has published a false factual statement that is about the person and that it also harms the person's reputation. The private plaintiff also must show that the defendant knew that the statement was false, or believed it was true but lacked a reasonable basis, or acted negligently in checking the facts. At first blush, that sounds like it fits perfectly, right? The Columbia report may go a long way toward establishing at least a modicum of the required intent. But that's only half the battle. There are strict rules about who can be a plaintiff in a defamation action like this. The identity of the aspiring plaintiff matters. First, let's eliminate UVA. The university is a public university, and therefore it is a governmental entity. The Supreme Court has been clear on the issue of libelous statements about the government: The government cannot sue for defamation. There is no such cause of action in American jurisprudence. Now the fraternities, starting with Phi Kappa Psi. A fraternity is not an individual, but a group. A plaintiff in a defamation case must show that the statements were ""of or concerning"" the plaintiff. It sounds obvious, but if you're going to say a statement hurt you, you have to prove the statement actually was about you to begin with. When the statements are about a group without naming an individual, it's hard to say the statement is ""concerning"" the individual -- and groups generally cannot sue.  For example, you can be sued if you call a specific lawyer a thief, but that same person cannot sue you if you simply call all lawyers thieves. Defamatory statements about a group are therefore not actionable by the group's individual members, for the most part. Like all rules, however, there are exceptions. If the defamatory language is about ""a comparatively small group of persons and the defamatory part is easily imputed against all members of the small group, an individual member may sue."" If I said, ""The 1980 Philadelphia Phillies infielders were a bunch of criminals"" (they weren't),  the individual players could sue, because that mean statement is clearly about certain persons -- if I said that -- which I didn't. Phi Kappa Psi would likely argue that the ""small group"" exception fits it perfectly: Even if the individual members were not identified by name, the defamatory story has been imputed directly to individual members, who have suffered by their association with the group. On the other hand, Rolling Stone's lawyers would likely argue that the group is so large and fluid (after all, the membership changes somewhat every year), that even though the fraternity's reputation is tarnished, the members have suffered no individualized injury. As for the other fraternities on campus but not implicated in the story, that's likely a group that moves from the small category to large, and the members of Greek life generally will have a harder time bringing a lawsuit. Lawyers will tell you that a libel suit is one of those things that citizens often threaten each other with on Facebook, but that such cases are rarely actually filed. That's because a plaintiff usually has to show some kind of financial harm. So if your Aunt Edna calls you a loser on Twitter, you're going to have to spend money on an expert to explain to a jury how that actually damaged you financially. And since most of the people who waste time threatening each other with defamation suits  on Facebook live in their moms' basements and are ""between jobs,"" these are not the kind of people who have money or reputation to damage in the first place. The UVA situation is not your run-of-the-mill defamation case. The university won't be able to sue, but if the members of the fraternity can get past some of the preliminary hurdles of a defamation claim, and they can make a tangible case for damages, then this could be one of those rare successful defamation cases.

"I remember traveling one day in the local train in Mumbai with my mother, my younger sister and brother. The compartment was extremely crowded. As we prepared to disembark, I felt my skirt being lifted and someone groping my private parts. It was terrible. I wanted to scream, but my voice would have drowned in the noise of the crowd. I wanted to push the hands away, but my arms were pinned to my body. I wanted to cry but could only think to myself, ""Stop it! Please stop touching me."" I was 13 years old. I never told anyone about that day until recently. Twenty-five years later, I continue to hear similar stories of women and girls being harassed on local transportation and other public spaces. The stories can be stomach churning: men masturbating on buses and at bus stops, boys stalking young girls -- both physically and online, men taking pictures of women without permission and uploading them on the Internet. Then there are just the everyday, uncomfortable stares, frequently accompanied by comments with sexual connotations. This isn't all simply anecdotal. A study by We the People found that 80% of women in Mumbai had been street harassed, primarily in crowded areas like trains and railway platforms. Most people, including women, only think of sexual violence as rape and tend to overlook touching, groping and stalking, not to mention the ""milder"" forms of ogling, leering, catcalling and whistling, even though all of this can be intimidating. Indeed, many women choose to limit their hours outside, select more conservative clothes, or opt for a longer but safer route home. It was only recently that I realized my phobia of trains likely originated with that bad experience I had as a child. I still avoid trains when I can. Most people are silent when inappropriate sexual behavior occurs to women. It was depressing to hear one young college student tell me in a recent sexual harassment workshop I led that ""staring and commenting by men is normal and I've learned to ignore it."" The reality is that sexual harassment in India is pervasive in all aspects of life. It hits you in the face every day when you walk down the street, take local transport, go about your daily routine or at the workplace. According to U.N. Women's report, 1 in 3 women around the world face some form of sexual violence at least once in their lifetime. This statistic is likely even higher in India. Out of the 2,000 women who have attended workshops I've conducted, only a handful of them have never been at the receiving end of harassment in some setting of their daily lives. Shockingly, less than 10 of them had reported harassment to any official channel. Why are we constantly limiting our options rather than confronting sexual harassment? Over the past two years, I have been working to encourage women to talk about their experiences and realize the tremendous potential power they hold within themselves through acknowledging the problem and being a part of the change to shift the culture around sexual harassment in India. It is not always easy speaking up about sexual harassment. I know firsthand. But acknowledging that it is unacceptable is an important first step. India has laws for sexual violence in public spaces as well as at the workplace, and knowing these rules gives women the power to confront her harasser. But is it enough? Women still have to confront the cultural challenge of not feeling ""ashamed"" and bringing ""disrepute"" to their families while overcoming their fear of dealing with the police, who too often file complaints in the wrong categories to reduce the number of official cases on which their performance is judged. However, despite the barriers, two recent cases in India provide proof that even when the perpetrator is in a position of immense power, coming forward to report sexual harassment can make a difference. There is, for example, the young employee from an environmental research organization who alleged that her boss Rajendra Pachauri made unwelcome advances to her through text messages. Her bold and persistent quest for justice resulted in Pachauri stepping down from his position as chair of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Pachauri denied the allegations and insisted his computer and phone were hacked. His counsel stated in court that Pachauri's inbox was not hacked, but he had shared the password with several people who could have sent inappropriate emails to the employee under his name. Similarly, last year, Tarun Tejpal, founder of one of India's leading media companies, was arrested for sexually assaulting his employee in an elevator. She first told her female editor who reportedly did not take her seriously.  She then spoke about it to her male colleagues who encouraged her to report the incident to the police. Tarun Tejpal, who explained the incident as a ""bad lapse of judgment,"" was let out on interim bail while the case is still ongoing. Women have allies -- both male and female -- who are willing to help clear the barriers. Women everywhere just need to find the courage to speak up. The alternative to speaking out is a world where women feel less able to live full lives, restricted and disempowered. We cannot accept harassment as part of our daily routine. We cannot ignore it -- for our own sake and the next generation of women.

"Social Security: 3.2% Benefit Increase in 2024
The Social Security Administration announced that over 71 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits will see a 3.2 percent increase in their checks next year to help them keep up with inflation. While this adjustment is higher than the typical cost-of-living adjustment, it is significantly lower than last year's record-setting 8.7 percent increase. The average monthly benefit for retired workers will rise by $59 to $1,907. This increase is vital for retirees, especially those with lower and middle incomes who rely heavily on Social Security as their primary source of retirement income. Unlike private savings and pensions, Social Security benefits are adjusted to account for inflation, helping retirees maintain their buying power over time.
However, rising Medicare Part B premiums may eat into some of these increases for retirees. It is worth noting that the method used to calculate cost-of-living adjustments has been a subject of debate, with some experts suggesting alternatives that better reflect the spending patterns of retirees. But the larger concern for Social Security is its looming funding shortfall, which could lead to significant benefit cuts if not addressed through adjustments to funding and benefits approved by Congress. The 3.2 percent increase in Social Security benefits comes as a relief to the millions of Americans who rely on this program for their retirement income.
However, it is important to recognize that this adjustment, while higher than the typical cost-of-living adjustment, falls far below the record-setting increase seen last year. Still, the average monthly benefit for retired workers rising by $59 to $1,907 will undoubtedly help retirees with lower and middle incomes to better cope with inflation.
One of the significant advantages of Social Security benefits is their adjustment to account for inflation, which helps retirees maintain their buying power over time. This feature sets it apart from other sources of retirement income, such as private savings and pensions, that do not automatically adjust for inflation. However, challenges persist, as rising Medicare Part B premiums may offset some of these increases for retirees.
Additionally, the debate surrounding the method used to calculate cost-of-living adjustments remains ongoing, with experts highlighting the need for alternatives that better reflect retirees' spending patterns. Furthermore, the imminent funding shortfall of Social Security poses a more significant concern, as it could lead to substantial benefit cuts if not addressed through necessary adjustments to funding and benefits approved by Congress. Overall, while the increase in Social Security benefits is a step in the right direction, more comprehensive solutions are required to ensure the long-term stability of this vital program.

"Third degree burns, or full-thickness burns, are a type of burn that destroys the skin and may damage the underlying tissue. They are more severe than first or second degree burns and always require skin grafts. Third degree burns are a serious injury requiring immediate medical help. Unlike less severe burns, which can be very painful, full-thickness burns may not hurt. This is because the burn may damage nerve endings in the skin responsible for sensing pain. In addition, the burn site may appear white

grey

black

brown

yellow

charred

waxy or leathery A person with a third degree burn will require hospitalization. Treatment will vary depending on the extent, severity, and location of the burn. If an individual suspects they have a third degree burn, they should seek immediate medical attention. Without treatment, these burns and resulting complications can be fatal. In this article, learn more about third degree burns, including the symptoms, treatment, and when to speak with a doctor.

Definition Third degree burns are a severe type of burn that extends through every layer of skin. This type of burn can destroy: the epidermis, the outer layer of skin

the dermis, the layer beneath the epidermis

the hypodermis in some cases, which is the subcutaneous tissue and the innermost layer of skin Doctors categorize burns according to the damage they cause to the skin and surrounding tissue. Types of burns include : First degree burn : Also known as superficial burns , these are the most common type. This burn damages the outermost layer of skin and typically heals on its own within 1 week. A common example is sunburn.

Also known as , these are the most common type. This burn damages the outermost layer of skin and typically heals on its own within 1 week. A common example is sunburn. Second degree burn : Also known as partial-thickness burns, this type damages the top two layers of skin. Second degree burns may require a graft and typically leave scars.

Also known as partial-thickness burns, this type damages the top two layers of skin. Second degree burns may require a graft and typically leave scars. Third degree burn: These burns completely damage the skin, including hair follicles and sweat glands. They may also damage the underlying tissue and always require a skin graft.

These burns completely damage the skin, including hair follicles and sweat glands. They may also damage the underlying tissue and always require a skin graft. Fourth degree burn: This type of burn extends into fat.

This type of burn extends into fat. Fifth degree burn: This burn type extends into muscle.

This burn type extends into muscle. Sixth degree burn: This type of burn extends to the bone.

Causes Third degree burns will typically result from contact or exposure to the following: flames

flash from an explosive blast

chemicals such as acids

electricity

scalding liquids

contact with an extremely hot object for an extended period

Symptoms Any severe burn will typically be apparent and will require treatment at the hospital. Common symptoms Common symptoms of full-thickness burns may lead to: skin discoloration, which can include the skin becoming: white grey black brown yellow

skin appearing dry leathery waxy

swelling

a lack of pain due to damage to nerve endings Shock Severe burns can also result in potentially fatal complications . For example, the body may go into shock. Normally, the body produces an inflammatory response to protect itself from injury, infection, or other threats. However, in some cases, such as with severe burns, the body may overreact, and the inflammatory response may cause more harm. Shock typically causes damage because the extreme inflammatory response results in tissues and organs not receiving enough oxygen. Several organs, such as the lungs, heart, and brain, are particularly susceptible to damage by “ burn shock .” Infections Infection is another major concern with third degree burns. The severe damage to the skin makes the body more susceptible to pathogens. Burns can also weaken the immune system, meaning the body is less capable of fighting off infection. In particular, acquiring pneumonia and sepsis infections are common and potentially fatal complications.

Diagnosis A doctor can usually diagnose the severity of a burn by examining the affected area. They may also ask questions about the cause of the burn, any other injuries, and whether the person has any other medical conditions. The doctor may determine the severity of the burn by accounting for: the patient’s age

the percentage of total body surface area burned (TBSA) using the rule of nines

the type of burn

which body parts are involved A doctor may classify a severe burn under the following criteria : more than 10% TBSA in children or older adults

more than 20% TBSA in adults

more than 5% third degree

significant burns to the: face eyes ears joints genitalia



Treatment According to the World Health Organization (WHO) , any third degree burn requires immediate hospitalization and treatment. Individuals with this type of burn usually receive treatment at a special burn unit. Following a third degree burn, people should immediately try to arrange medical assistance. While waiting for emergency care, a person can ensure an individual with a third degree burn: is out of harm’s way

is breathing

has restrictive items and clothing near, but not on, the wound removed People can also cover the area with a sterile bandage, attempt to separate fingers and toes if burned, and, if possible, elevate the burned area above the heart. The treatment a person receives will depend on the extent, severity, and location of the burn. The cause of the burn and a person’s health will also determine which treatment they receive. Treatment for third degree burns may include: Surgery: Third degree burns typically require multiple surgeries to remove burned tissue from the burn site.

Third degree burns typically require multiple surgeries to remove burned tissue from the burn site. Skin graft: As third degree burns do not heal by themselves, a skin graft is often necessary. A doctor may use a combination of natural skin grafts, artificial skin products, or laboratory-grown skin.

Some people may receive extra fluids to maintain their blood pressure and prevent shock. Medication: A person will likely receive several different medications, such as antibiotics and pain medication, to prevent infection and ease pain.

A person will likely receive several different medications, such as antibiotics and pain medication, to prevent infection and ease pain. Tetanus shot: As tetanus bacteria are more likely to trigger infections through burn wounds, a person may receive a tetanus shot to prevent this.

When to see a doctor Third degree burns are serious and require immediate medical attention. Without treatment, they can be fatal. The WHO estimate that burns cause roughly 180,000 deaths every year, while non-fatal burn injuries are a leading cause of morbidity. Children and older adults are particularly at risk. Research suggests that after car accidents and drowning, burns are the most frequent cause of childhood death. The American Burn Association provide resources allowing people to search for their nearest burn center in the United States.

Recovery Treatment for third degree burns continues after a person leaves the hospital. While the recovery period differs for everyone, people commonly report feeling pain, fatigue, and itching. People will still require wound care, which involves cleansing and dressing the wounds. This may require a nurse or doctor, or for the person with burns to learn how to clean and dress wounds. A friend or family member could also assist.



Individuals may require rehabilitation and counseling to help with their ability to perform daily tasks, with any potential issues communicating, and improve their mental health. The healing time of a burn injury depends on the: burn extent

burn depth

location of the burn

person’s age

presence of other injuries or conditions Due to medical advances, people are now capable of recovering from burn injuries that were previously fatal. However, individuals will often have permanent impairments and scarring.

Diagnosis

If you go to a doctor for burn treatment, he or she will assess the severity of your burn by examining your skin. He or she may recommend that you be transferred to a burn center if your burn covers more than 10 percent of your total body surface area, is very deep, is on the face, feet or groin, or meets other criteria established by the American Burn Association.

Your doctor will check for other injuries and might order lab tests, X-rays or other diagnostic procedures.

Treatment

Most minor burns can be treated at home. They usually heal within a couple of weeks.

For serious burns, after appropriate first aid and wound assessment, your treatment may involve medications, wound dressings, therapy and surgery. The goals of treatment are to control pain, remove dead tissue, prevent infection, reduce scarring risk and regain function.

People with severe burns may require treatment at specialized burn centers. They may need skin grafts to cover large wounds. And they may need emotional support and months of follow-up care, such as physical therapy.

Medical treatment

After you have received first aid for a major burn, your medical care may include medications and products that are intended to encourage healing.

Water-based treatments. Your care team may use techniques such as ultrasound mist therapy to clean and stimulate the wound tissue.

If you develop an infection, you may need antibiotics. Tetanus shot. Your doctor might recommend a tetanus shot after a burn injury.

Physical and occupational therapy

If the burned area is large, especially if it covers any joints, you may need physical therapy exercises. These can help stretch the skin so that the joints can remain flexible. Other types of exercises can improve muscle strength and coordination. And occupational therapy may help if you have difficulty doing your normal daily activities.

Surgical and other procedures

You may need one or more of the following procedures:

Breathing assistance. If you've been burned on the face or neck, your throat may swell shut. If that appears likely, your doctor may insert a tube down your windpipe (trachea) to keep oxygen supplied to your lungs.

If you've been burned on the face or neck, your throat may swell shut. If that appears likely, your doctor may insert a tube down your windpipe (trachea) to keep oxygen supplied to your lungs. Feeding tube. People with extensive burns or who are undernourished may need nutritional support. Your doctor may thread a feeding tube through your nose to your stomach.

People with extensive burns or who are undernourished may need nutritional support. Your doctor may thread a feeding tube through your nose to your stomach. Easing blood flow around the wound. If a burn scab (eschar) goes completely around a limb, it can tighten and cut off the blood circulation. An eschar that goes completely around the chest can make it difficult to breathe. Your doctor may cut the eschar to relieve this pressure.

Plastic surgery (reconstruction) can improve the appearance of burn scars and increase the flexibility of joints affected by scarring.

Lifestyle and home remedies

To treat minor burns, follow these steps:

Cool the burn. Hold the burned area under cool (not cold) running water or apply a cool, wet compress until the pain eases. Don't use ice. Putting ice directly on a burn can cause further damage to the tissue.

Hold the burned area under cool (not cold) running water or apply a cool, wet compress until the pain eases. Don't use ice. Putting ice directly on a burn can cause further damage to the tissue. Remove rings or other tight items. Try to do this quickly and gently, before the burned area swells.

Try to do this quickly and gently, before the burned area swells. Don't break blisters. Fluid-filled blisters protect against infection. If a blister breaks, clean the area with water (mild soap is optional). Apply an antibiotic ointment. But if a rash appears, stop using the ointment.

Take a pain reliever. Over-the-counter medications, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve) or acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), can help relieve pain.

Over-the-counter medications, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve) or acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), can help relieve pain. Consider a tetanus shot. Make sure that your tetanus booster is up to date. Doctors recommend that people get a tetanus shot at least every 10 years.

Whether your burn was minor or serious, use sunscreen and moisturizer regularly once the wound is healed.

Coping and support

Coping with a serious burn injury can be a challenge, especially if it covers large areas of your body or is in places readily seen by other people, such as your face or hands. Potential scarring, reduced mobility and possible surgeries add to the burden.

Consider joining a support group of other people who have had serious burns and know what you're going through. You may find comfort in sharing your experience and struggles and meeting people who face similar challenges. Ask your doctor for information on support groups in your area or online.

Preparing for your appointment

Seek emergency medical care for burns that are deep or involve your hands, feet, face, groin, buttocks, a major joint or a large area of the body. Your emergency room physician may recommend examination by a skin specialist (dermatologist), burn specialist, surgeon or other specialist.

For other burns, you may need an appointment with your family doctor. The information below can help you prepare.

List questions you want to ask your doctor, such as:

Do I need treatment for the burn?

What are my treatment options and the pros and cons of each?

What are the alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?

Can I wait to see if the burn heals on its own?

Do I need prescription medication, or can I use over-the-counter medications to treat the burn?

What results can I expect?

What skin care routines do you recommend while the burn heals?

What kind of follow-up, if any, will I need?

What changes in my skin might I expect to see as it heals?

What to expect from your doctor

"One of Pink’s biggest chart-toppers was her 2001 hit “Get the Party Started”, but if things had gone according to plan the song would have been a hit for Madonna, not Pink.
That revelation comes directly from famed producer, songwriter and 4 Non Blondes frontwoman Linda Perry, who divulged that was the original path in mind for her song.
Speaking with Rolling Stone , Perry explained the origins of the the Pink hit, which was certified gold in the U.S. and peaked at #4 on the Billboard Top 200 chart.
“’Get the Party Started’ was just me figuring out what all this stuff does. I came up with that beat, laid it down, found all these weird chords and sounds and put the horns…I picked up a microphone and said, ‘I’m just going to say every clichéd line I can think of.’ And I came up with, ‘Get the party started on a Saturday night’ and wrote a bunch of stuff down. I called up my manager afterwards and said, ‘I just wrote a damn hit.’ It was too easy,” she said, recounting the stories behind the 15 most significant songs she’s written.
“I sent it to Madonna and she passed, but a week later, Alecia [a.k.a. Pink ] called,” she continued. “She left me this really crazy message how she would come find me if I didn’t call her back. I saw what she looked like — she was a bling-bling girl — and I said, ‘I think you have the wrong Linda Perry .’ She’s like, ‘Is this the Linda Perry who sang ‘Dear Mister President’ in 4 Non Blondes ?’ I’m like, ‘Yeah.’ She’s like, ‘Well, I have the right person.’ I had just written ‘Get the Party Started’ and I go, ‘Well, I’ve got something I wrote last week,’ and sent it to her. I guess she sent it to [producer] LA Reid and they said, ‘OK, we have our first single.’”
According to Perry, Pink is “awesome. She’s so sassy. We were sitting one day and I said, ‘This album’s going to be huge.’ She laughed at me. But I was like, ‘It’s going to be a groundbreaking record and change things for you.’ She didn’t believe me. But we completely changed her format and it worked. And my life took a complete turn. That song put me on everybody’s Blackberry at the time. All the boy bands were reaching out.”
However, Perry “just was not interested” in going that route. “I’m an artist. I’m not a hit-maker,” she added. “My intention is never to go write a hit. I don’t even understand how to do that. I just can only stay as true as possible, and either one’s going to happen or it’s not. My main focus is always to write a great song. That’s what I do. I don’t write bad songs. I write great songs. Some of them are hits, some of them are not.”
“Get the Party Started”, she admitted, still holds a special place in her heart. “But with that song, it became clear to me that helping artists with their vision is kind of cool,” she said. “I got the bug. It’s not me and my drab emotions. I was putting on Alecia’s clothes every day as she came in. It was an escape from myself.”","""Get the Party Started"" was released in 2001 and was sung by American singer Pink, as revealed by producer, songwriter and 4 Non Blondes frontwoman Linda Perry.",1,1,0.630779504776001

Ben & Holly's Little Kingdom is a British preschool animated television series . [2] The show was created by Neville Astley and Mark Baker , and produced by Astley Baker Davies and Entertainment One (the companies responsible for Peppa Pig ). [3] Many of the voice actors who worked on Peppa Pig have lent their voices to the show; these include John Sparkes , Sarah Ann Kennedy , David Rintoul and David Graham . The music is produced by Julian Nott , who is noted for his Wallace and Gromit and Peppa Pig scores. [4] Ben & Holly's Little Kingdom is the third show to be produced by Astley Baker Davies. [ citation needed ]
The show is set in the Little Kingdom which is hidden among thorny brambles. The Little Kingdom is ruled by King and Queen Thistle, mainly from the Little Castle, where they live with their three daughters; 8-year-old Princess Holly, and younger twins Daisy and Poppy. Elves including 8-year-old Ben live at the Great Elf Tree, which acts as a school, library, apartment block and factory for toys and wands. Elves hold the belief that they should never arrive late to anything. Civil fairies live in the Fairy Village, which consists of toadstools which have doors and windows.
Fairies use magic and most of the fairies are named after flowers or other plants . Elves have their own catchphrase, ""...and I'm an Elf"" (or ""We're Elves""), commonly tooting their instrument (most often a horn ) afterward. Fairies also have their catchphrase, commonly ""I'm a fairy"", sometimes waving their wands afterwards as a kind of parody of the elves’ culture. Elves tell the time with wrist watches and/or clocks , while fairies tell the time with the sounds of different kinds of birds . The Elves operate Elf Rescue, the Elf Farm and the Elf Windmill. King Thistle likes to play golf and Ben & Holly's invention, crazy golf at the Royal Course. Ben and Holly have a ladybird friend called Gaston. Nanny Plum and the Wise Old Elf are characters too, and they have important jobs to do in the context of the show. Mr. and Mrs. Elf are Ben's parents.
- Ben Elf is an 8-year-old elf, and one of the titular protagonists alongside his best friend, Princess Holly. He lives with his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Elf in a tree (known as Great Elf Tree) alongside with all the other elves. He can be quite tentative when it comes to using magic, as he is a young elf and elves generally dislike the use of magic. He does not have any siblings but has plenty of friends, his best friend is Princess Holly. He is a patient young elf, whenever the two (Holly and Ben) go out to play Holly is often late but he patiently waits for her every time, even though Holly is seldom punctual in meetings, nearly forgetting his birthday once. Ben is voiced by Preston Nyman.
- Holly Thistle, more commonly known as Princess Holly, is an 8-year-old fairy, and one of the titular protagonists alongside her best friend, Ben Elf. She is a cheerful, tidy and clever princess who lives with her parents, King and Queen Thistle, her younger twin sisters, Daisy and Poppy and the royal family's nanny, Nanny Plum. She likes to use magic despite the risk of things going wrong, a reference to the great curiosity in young children. She likes playing with Ben Elf and there is a lot of platonic love between them. Holly is voiced by Sian Taylor.
- King Thistle is the King of the Little Kingdom and the husband of Queen Thistle. He is also Princess Holly, Daisy, and Poppy's father. He is often hungry and grumpy and sometimes hates having a bath though he can be quite a gentle, kind and loving father. He dislikes celebrating his birthday because it reminds him he is getting older. King Thistle is voiced by Ian Puleston-Davies .
- Queen Thistle is the Queen consort of the Little Kingdom and the wife of King Thistle. She is also Princess Holly, Daisy, and Poppy's mother. Her personality is much like Holly's, kind-hearted, loving and sweet though she too can become quite upset or serious if something has gone wrong. She is possibly the only person who can handle looking after Daisy and Poppy, though at times even she can be overwhelmed by the trouble they cause with their magic. She is Queen Marigold's younger sister. Queen Thistle is voiced by Sara Crowe .
- Daisy and Poppy are Holly's 3-year-old younger twin sisters. They are not very good at magic and don't know that many spells as they are only toddlers, but this does not stop them from trying to cause chaos with the dangerous spells they do know. They are quite cheeky and usually end up causing trouble with magic. As Daisy and Poppy can be very naughty, Holly sometimes dislikes her sisters due to the trouble they cause with their magic. Most of the adult characters are wary of them too, though Queen Thistle seems to be able to deal with them for the most part. Daisy and Poppy are voiced by Zoë Baker, the same voice actress acting as the zebra twins from Peppa Pig .
- Nanny Plum is Holly, Daisy, and Poppy's nanny , and a general housekeeper for the King and Queen. She is very good at magic and capable of speaking many animal languages (including ones which she claims to be a bit difficult such as Mole , Aardvark , Ant , Centipede and even Alien ). She often ends up in all kinds of trouble when trying to help Holly and her friends. She is also a tooth fairy. Although being quite bossy and savage she usually is a helpful and funny character. She is very good at cleaning with magic. She rivals the Wise Old Elf mainly due to their differing opinions over the use of magic. She is a teacher at the Fairy School. Nanny Plum is voiced by Sarah Ann Kennedy , the same voice actress acting as Miss Rabbit and Mummy Rabbit from Peppa Pig .
- Cedric Elf, more commonly known as The Wise Old Elf, lives near the top of the Great Elf Tree. Since he is the series' ""Jack of all trades, master of none"", he also is the Wise Old Tailor, Wise Old Plumber, the elf doctor and the librarian. He also runs the Elf School and the Elf factory. He rivals Nanny Plum and strongly disapproves of the use of magic, but used to admire magic and enjoyed himself when he was briefly given the ability to use magic. He also secretly used magic to fuel the Elf Engine that runs the Elf Factory, as it is clean energy (""a very small carbon footprint "" he claims) and never runs out except on No Magic Day which occurs every blue moon. He has three kids, two of which are pirates, Redbeard the Elf Pirate and Captain Squid, and an elf son who dreamed of becoming a Viking, as shown in the episode 'Father's Day'. The Wise Old Elf's real name is Cedric, as what Granny and Grandpapa Thistle address him. He went to college with Granny and Grandpapa Thistle. He was known to be married, although his wife may have passed away before the show, thus making him a widower. He has a twin brother, an Arctic Elf named ""The Wiser Older Elf"". The Wise Old Elf is voiced by David Graham . A running gag is that Elf Rescue, run by the Wise Old Elf, is a parody of International Rescue in the 1960s television series Thunderbirds , with comparable rocket-powered rescue vehicles and similar strident accompanying music. David Graham, who voices the Wise Old Elf, also voiced Aloysius Parker the chauffeur in Thunderbirds , the same voice actress acting as Grandpa Pig from Peppa Pig .
- Mr. Elf is Ben Elf's father and Mrs. Elf's husband. He is very serious and often likes hard work. He is the food deliverer to the fairies and elves and delivers presents to Father Christmas. He once was a sailor and he quite enjoyed being one until a fish known as ""Big Bad Barry"", ate most of his boats after that experience he decided he will not sail again. He retired and instead worked to deliver food to the people of the Little Kingdom.
- Mrs. Elf is Ben Elf's mother and Mr. Elf's wife. She is a very caring and cheerful female adult elf who enjoys taking holidays (although it was her desire thanks to Mr. Elf's hard-working attitude which probably kept them from doing so). Mrs. Elf is like a typical housewife, helping out with her family's chores. Mrs. Elf also help the family out by making food. She is voiced by Judy Flynn .
- Gaston the Ladybird is a male ladybird who lives in a small cave. He likes his house being messy as well as food that is ""smelly and foul"". He does not mind giving Ben rides when Ben needs to fly. Nanny Plum, who understands Ladybird language, translates for him quite often. He acts quite similarly to a dog, making a barking sound when he ""speaks"", and also fetching sticks. Gaston has a brother, Tony, a sister-in-law, Pam, two nieces, Amber and Emerald, and a nephew, Keith. Gaston is voiced by Taig McNab, who is also credited as Editor for Ben & Holly's Little Kingdom . Gaston also has a production company named after him, ""Gaston's Cave Limited"" and it is currently credited for season 6 of Peppa Pig .
- Lucy Big is an 8-year-old girl who lives with her parents in the Big (normal) World. She, her mum (Mrs. Big), her dad (Mr. Big) and her teacher, Miss Cookie are the only big people who know about the Little Kingdom. She is voiced by Abigail Daniels.
- Miss Jolly is a snail riding teacher and a pet trainer. She also has a snail called Trigger.
- Redbeard the Elf Pirate (Nigel) is the pirate uncle of Barnaby Elf and also the son of the Wise Old Elf. He is introduced in series 1, episode 31, where it is also revealed that his real name is Nigel. He sails the oceans in a pirate ship named Pedro, though his size prevents him from engaging in acts of actual piracy, and he is more of a treasure hunter and explorer. He is quite smitten with Nanny Plum whom he considers to be his sweetheart, however Nanny Plum seems to have little interest in him romantically but deep down, Nanny Plum loves him back. He has a pet parrot, Polly, although she is normal-sized and barely fits inside Redbeard's ship. He is voiced by David Rintoul .
- Mrs. Fig is the teacher of Mrs. Fig's Magic School who notably speaks with a Scottish accent. Nanny Plum used to go there and Holly and her friends went there when they were old enough. Despite being a fairy, she detests magic and says the most important rules of magic are ""Don't use magic"" and ""Magic should only be used for serious things"". As a result, the Wise Old Elf likes her as they have similar views on magic. Mrs. Fig loathes Nanny Plum, who is implied to have been her worst student as she does not adhere to Mrs. Fig's ideas on magic. Mrs. Fig is voiced by Morwenna Banks .
- Mrs. Fotheringill is Daisy and Poppy's playgroup teacher. She was at one point sent back in time to the age of the dinosaurs by the children from her playgroup. She seems to be American due to her accent and when she called Gaston a ""ladybug"" (not to mention mistaking his gender). She is presumably an elf, although her ears are hidden under her bob and she has never been seen blowing her horn. Mrs. Fotheringill is voiced by Morwenna Banks.
- Mr. Gnome is a gnome that often wanders around the Little Kingdom ever since Nanny Plum magicked him into the Little Kingdom to keep moles out of the golf course. He later turned out to be a lazy, big talkative, and gluttonous annoyance to the entire kingdom. After his debut appearance, whenever the characters find him, they scream in horror ""Ah! The Gnome!"" with a bass drum soundtrack representing the characters' fear.
- Gloria Gnome is presumably Mr. Gnome's ""girlfriend"". She was introduced in the episode, ""Springtime"". Gloria is voiced by Judy Flynn.
- King and Queen Marigold are the king and queen of a far-away kingdom far from the Little Kingdom. They are often described as ""snooty"" characters who tease and laugh at the Thistle family's misfortunes, such as judging the Little Castle and calling it a ""shady-old"" castle. But when their plans go wrong and most of the castle was demolished, the Marigolds unexpectedly find the remnants of their castle ""modern"" and ""daring"" instead of teasing them as Queen Thistle predicted. The Marigolds are a cheerful, happy-go-lucky and snooty satire of high-brow trends in modern art and fashion. Queen Marigold is Queen Thistle's older sister, making the Marigolds part of the Thistle family and the uncle and aunt of Holly, Daisy, and Poppy. Their castle appears to be based of Saint Basil's Cathedral in Moscow. King Marigold is voiced by John Sparkes and Queen Marigold is voiced by Morwenna Banks.
- Milicent ""Granny"" Thistle is King Thistle's mother and Victor's wife. She often believes in using strong and dangerous magic and became a bad influence on Daisy and Poppy by teaching them how to do it and giving them the wands of their great-grandparents, hence a reference to how some grandparents spoil their grandchildren. It was her who revealed that The Wise Old Elf used to love magic, right before the Monkey's Kittens incident. She lives with Victor in a castle high in the clouds.
- Victor ""Grandpapa"" Thistle is King Thistle's father and Milicent's husband. He is ""extremely bonkers"" and along with his wife, he also believes in using wacky and dangerous magic. He, Milicent, and the Wise Old Elf (who they referred to by his real name, Cedric), attended the same college, and like Milicent, he too spoiled Daisy and Poppy in his last appearance in the episode ""Journey to the Centre of the Earth"" by intending to take them on a trip to a volcano.
- Mrs. Witch is a witch who lives in a small cottage in the Little Kingdom. Although there was a time Holly wanted to know if she was evil, she turned out to be a nice witch who only gets angry or does something bad (like when she turned Nanny Plum into stone) when she is insulted, especially the fact that she is touchy about her private cat, Moggy.
- Captain Squid is also a pirate, along with Redbeard the Elf Pirate. He is Redbeard's brother and also the Wise Old Elf's son. Captain Squid is voiced by Andy Hamilton .
- Barnaby Elf is a cheerful, loud, talkative and giggly friend of Ben, He is Redbeard the Elf Pirate’s son and also the Wise Old Elf's grandson. Barnaby is voiced by Stanley Nickless.
- Strawberry Fairy is a fairy who is friends with Holly and often attends lessons with her. She is very cheerful, happy-go-lucky, bubbly and silly, and has her hair styled in a small tulip bun. Her mum is the vet of the Little Kingdom. Strawberry is voiced by Zara Siddiqi.
- The Fairy Mayor is a character based on Boris Johnson , the former mayor of London and former prime minister of the United Kingdom . He is Strawberry's dad. He does not like ""big people"" because they always step on fairies and elves. He is voiced by Alexander Armstrong.
- Zyros is an alien that lives on Planet Bong. He gets offended when he is called a baby, he likes magic jelly and he has a fear of big people. The character was voiced by Bram Karek.

"[1] During thundersnows, the snow dampens the thunder so it sounds like a muffled timpani drum rather than the loud cracking and booming of a summer thunderstorm. Bolts of lightning slice through the sky, creating an eerie look.

[2] Cold winter air typically doesn’t contain a lot of moisture and so isn’t conducive to thunderstorms.
Air instability is also important to thunderstorm formation. It commonly occurs when warm air near the surface of the Earth rises due to convection–in the classic case, on a sunny summer day when the ground gets hot and warms up the air immediately above it. As the hot air rises, cooler air descends to replace it. If conditions are right, strong updrafts can form that quickly move the warm, humid surface air up to the higher reaches of the troposphere, where the water vapor in the air cools and condenses to fall as rain (or ice, if it’s cold enough). These updrafts are a hallmark of thunderstorms–the strong upward motion of the air encourages the interactions between water droplets and ice crystals that can lead to lightning. In winter, cold surface air temperatures and reduced sunlight mean there’s less surface heating, less convection, and thus fewer opportunities for thunderstorms.

[3] > Doesn't lightning only occur in high humidity as well? In the winter, there is barely any humidity in the air, so there's no lightning. Right?We usually have thundersnow at least a couple of times each winter. Maine is in a kind of unique place, though, in which we can get arctic highs spilling in from Canada and colliding with warmer, wetter air coming up the Eastern seaboard and off the Gulf of Maine.

[4] The most common ""cold"" thunderstorms are known as elevated thunderstorms. These storms can occur when it is cold at the surface, but there is a warm layer higher up in the atmosphere that provides the energy to the storms.
Elavated thunderstorms occur a lot on the north side of a warm front, where warm air is surging in above our heads, but the warm air at the surface hasn't quite made it into the area yet.
Ever wonder why these elevated storms seem to have long, drawn-out thunder compared to thunderstorms that occur when it's warm at the surface? With cold air at the surface and warm air above it, the warm air will act as a kind of ceiling, or insulator, to things like sound waves. The sound waves from thunder will hit the bottom of the warm air layer and will bounce back to the ground, which causes the sound of thunder to last much longer.",Air instability is also important to thunderstorm formation.,1,1,0.9888803958892822

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN)An explosion late Thursday outside a bus station in the northeast Nigerian city of Gombe ‎killed at least five people and injured more than a dozen others, witnesses said. The explosion outside the Bauchi Motor Park‎ happened around 8:30 p.m. after a woman left her explosives-laden handbag near a bus filling up with passengers. The bus was heading to the central Nigerian city of Jos, 125 kilometers away. ""There has been an explosion just outside the motor park and five people have been killed while more than 12 others have been seriously injured,"" said Adamu Saidu, an employee at the bus station. ""Some of the injured have had their limbs blown off‎ and one of them has had his eye gouged out,"" said Saidu, who was involved in the evacuation of the victims to a hospital. The woman pretended to be going to Jos and lingered around the bus, which was ‎waiting to fill up with passengers, according to Falalu Tasiu, a grocer near the bus station. ""The woman kept talking on the phone and dropped her bag beside the bus, pretending to be waiting for the bus to fill up,"" Tasiu said. ""She moved towards shops overlooking the bus station as if she was going to buy something and disappeared. Moments later the bag exploded and set the bus on fire, killing five people and inujuring around 15 others,"" Tasiu said. Although no one has claimed responsibility for the attack, Boko Haram Islamists have repeatedly carried out suicide and bombing attacks on bus stations and markets in Gombe and other northern cities, making the group the main suspect. Boko Haram has in recent months been under sustained pressure from sweeping offensives from a four-nation regional alliance of Nigeria, Chad, Niger and Cameroon. The regional offensives have considerably weakened Boko Haram's capabilities, which has prompted the Islamists to resort to attacks on soft targets such as bus stations, markets and schools. The explosion was the first attack since Nigeria held its presidential election at the weekend, which was won by opposition candidate Muhammadu Buhari, who vowed to crush Boko Haram when he assumes office in late May.

"38 and home. The Kentucky Wildcats' bid for perfection ended Saturday night at the hands of the Wisconsin Badgers, who rallied for a tough 71-64 victory in the NCAA men's basketball Final Four at Indianapolis. They will meet four-time national champ Duke in Monday night's title game. The Blue Devils dominated Michigan State 81-61 in the first contest of the night. National player of the year finalist Frank Kaminsky led Wisconsin with 20 points and 11 rebounds. Junior forward Sam Dekker added 16 points. ""These guys just gutted it out.,"" Wisconsin Head Coach Bo Ryan said. ""We just kept battling on every possession."" Freshman Karl-Anthony Towns led Kentucky with 16 points. Sophomore Andrew Harrison chipped in 13 points while Aaron Harrison had 12 points. Kentucky came into the game as the first men's team to have a 38-0 record. But the Badgers fought back from a 60-56 deficit with 6:39 left in the game. Wisconsin went on an 8-0 run to regain a lead it never relinquished. It will be looking to win its first title since 1941. As the final minutes ticked off, the Wildcats failed to score. They were stuck on 60 for five minutes. The Harrison twins, who shot well in the first half, couldn't get much done offensively. ""I didn't execute. I mean, we didn't execute as a team, but me being the point guard, I didn't do what coach told me to on a couple of occasions,"" Andrew Harrison said at the postgame news conference. His coach sternly interjected. ""He did fine. He did fine,"" John Calipari said. Meanwhile, Dekker stepped up, making a layup, a three-pointer and a free throw as the Badgers scooted ahead. Calipari said the Badgers did a good job defending the Kentucky big men. ""They crowded us a little bit, and (our) guys got a little tentative,"" he said. Calipari looked at the stat sheet: Kentucky had only six turnovers, hit 90% of its free throws, made 48% of its field goals, and lost. He said his team struggled to guard Wisconsin's players, and the rebound battle -- which Wisconsin won by 12 -- was crucial. Kamisky, who turned 22 on Saturday, was asked how the Badgers outrebounded a team that is the tallest in basketball. ""We stayed into them, attacking them, trying to do whatever we can,"" he said. ""Just trying to keep them off the glass was one of our main priorities."" Freshman Justise Winslow led Duke with 19 points while national freshman of the year Jahlil Okafor had 18 points, 10 of which came in the first half. Senior guard Quinn Cook had 17. ""The defense was terrific,"" Duke Head Coach Mike Krzyzewski said. ""We drove the ball with such strength. I actually think our offense gave our defense a push."" Junior guard Denzel Valentine sparked the Spartans with three early three-pointers and finished with 22 points and a game-high 11 rebounds. Senior guard Travis Trice had 16 points. The Spartans, of the Big Ten, began the game in a higher gear than Duke, and quickly took an eight-point lead. But after Valentine hit his trio of long-range shots and Michigan State led 14-6, the Spartans struggled to get baskets the rest of the first half. ""They did a good job of denying us and forcing us out (farther from the basket). We took some bad shots,"" Valentine said. Duke occasionally used a 2-3 zone defense that protected some of its players with foul concerns and slowed the Spartans down. But it was when Duke played man-to-man that the Spartans really had a hard time scoring. State made five of its first seven shots, then only made three more in the final 16 minutes of the opening half. The Blue Devils, of the Atlantic Coast Conference, found baskets inside as the 6-foot-11, 270-pound Okafor powered for points around the basket. Winslow used his quickness to score seven points in the first half, but he only played 12 minutes because he committed two fouls. Duke led at halftime 36-25, a turnaround of 19 points from its early deficit. ""Coach always stresses that great defense leads to great offense,"" Cook said. The confidence gained in getting defensive stops led to the desire for Duke players to drive the lane instead of shooting three-pointers. ""We saw seams that we could take advantage of,"" Cook said. In the second half, Duke increased its lead to 20 points, then cruised home. The Spartans were never able to cut the deficit to single digits and Duke sank its free throws in the final minutes. ""We got beat and ...  Duke played awfully well, but I thought it wasn't one of our better games,"" Michigan State head coach Tom Izzo said. The Blue Devils apparently like playing in Final Fours in Indianapolis, home of the NCAA. It won titles there in 1991 and 2010. The other two crowns came in 1992 and 2001, each in Minneapolis. Duke has beaten Wisconsin this season, 80-70 in Wisconsin in December. If Duke wins Monday night, it would tie Indiana and North Carolina for third-most NCAA championships with five.

"Boston (CNN)When the bomb went off, Steve Woolfenden thought he was still standing. That was because, as he lay on the ground, he was still holding the handles of his son's stroller. He pulled back the stroller's cover and saw that his son, Leo, 3, was conscious but bleeding from the left side of his head. Woolfenden checked Leo for other injuries and thought, ""Let's get out of here."" That was before he noticed his Achilles tendon, which resembled transparent tape covered in blood, and his left tibia protruding from his boot. The boot was next to his left stump, he testified before a federal jury Thursday, the third day in which survivors and family members of those killed in the Boston Marathon bombing shared their stories -- often gruesome and heartbreaking -- in the sentencing phase for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The prosecution rested Thursday afternoon after attempting to convince jurors that Tsarnaev was cold-hearted and remorseless. The defense, led by famed death penalty opponent Judy Clarke, is expected to try to soften that portrayal by calling witnesses to explain Tsarnaev's difficult upbringing. Clarke will begin those efforts Monday. A group of Tsarnaev's relatives arrived at Boston's Logan International Airport on Thursday, CNN affiliate WHDH reported, but it's not clear if they plan to testify. The jury must decide whether the 21-year-old, who has been found guilty of perpetrating the attack with his now-deceased brother, will die for his crimes or spend his life in prison. Woolfenden, a biomedical researcher for the Novartis Institutes, recalled using his belt as a tourniquet on his leg and trying to comfort Leo. The boy cried, ""Mommy! Daddy! Mommy! Daddy! Mommy! Daddy! Mommy! Daddy!"" he testified. Amid the stench of ""burning hair, blood, sulfur,"" a good Samaritan emerged. He gave Woolfenden another tourniquet and rushed Leo to safety. ""I was completely terrified because I didn't know if I was ever going to see my son again. There was blood all over the sidewalk, all around me,"" he said. Dr. David King, a trauma surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital, spent 14 years in the U.S. Army as a combat surgeon and served in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as in Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake. He has treated and operated on hundreds of troops injured by improvised explosive devices, he testified, and what he saw in Boston that day wasn't much different from the carnage he witnessed in war zones. ""I arrived just as the first wave of casualties had shown up,"" he said. ""I looked across the patients and I knew immediately, without anyone having to tell me, exactly what the wounding mechanism was."" Heather Abbott had no such experience, so when one of the two bombs exploded, sending her through the doors of a restaurant and into a ""puddle of chaos and blood and glass,"" her instinct was to run. But she couldn't. Her foot felt like it was on fire, she testified. Two women helped her as she overheard someone saying a Hail Mary. She called for her husband. He picked her up and carried her out of the restaurant. ""I saw blood pouring out of my foot,"" she said. She finally got to a hospital, and after three attempts to save her foot, which was missing its entire heel, a doctor told her she had a decision: She could keep her leg and risk a life of excruciating pain or have it amputated below the knee. She chose the latter. ""It was probably the hardest decision I've had to make,"" she testified. Another marathon attendee rendered an amputee by the Tsarnaev brothers' attack, Marc Fucarile, recounted the two bombs going off. ""I stepped back, and the next thing I remember was looking up at the sky,"" he testified, adding that he remembered ""a lot of yelling, a lot of screaming, people crying out for tourniquets."" A nurse was sitting on his chest, and someone said, ""Oh, s***, he's on fire!"" He tried to undo his belt and got a third-degree burn because the buckle was so hot. A firefighter would later tell Fucarile that he handed his own right leg to the firefighter. He doesn't remember that. In addition to treating him for severe burns over much of his body, doctors had to cut off a bone and stretch muscle over the stub so that a prosthetic would fit. He still gets blisters. ""So where the prosthetic attaches on your butt, it rubs and breaks down and creates open wounds,"" he said. And though his left leg survived, it was severely burned, his calf muscle was blown off and his heel was shattered, he said. He hopes to save the left leg, he testified, but it's likely that it will have to be amputated above the knee. He takes more than 70 pills -- 24 pills in morning, 22 in afternoon, 26 at night -- to cope with his injuries, he said. One of the most dramatic points in Thursday's testimony involved the death of young Martin Richard. The prosecution showed close-up video of the 8-year-old, who was only 3½ feet from one of the bombs, according to the FBI's re-creation of the crime scene. His parents, Bill and Denise, are opposed to Tsarnaev receiving the death penalty and did not participate in the penalty phase, though Bill Richard did testify during the guilt phase. Dr. King told the court that Martin was especially vulnerable to the blast because he was so small and close to the ground, meaning the shrapnel more easily reached his head and torso. It's highly unlikely the boy died instantly, King said. Explaining that Martin died of rapid blood loss, King testified, ""Receptors are generally not responsive to cutting. If you happen to be awake and someone cuts your bowel or liver, it generally does not hurt. What hurts is the stretching and twisting. ... Intestines were pulled and twisted; that would have caused visceral type pain."" Woolfenden, the biomedical researcher, recalled seeing Martin and his mother shortly after the good Samaritan took Woolfenden's son, Leo, to safety. ""I saw Martin's face, and I could see a boy that looked like he was fatally injured,"" he said,. Martin's hair was singed, his eyes had rolled back into his head and his mouth was agape. As for Martin's torso, ""I saw an immense amount of blood. I was really, really terrified,"" Woolfenden said. He recalled Denise Richard pleading with her son, saying, ""please"" and ""Martin"" over and over. Woolfenden placed his hand on Denise Richard's back, he said. She turned to ask Woolfenden if he was OK. He said he was, and she turned her attention back to Martin. But no response came. According to testimony, Martin's aorta was nearly severed and he was eviscerated by shrapnel from the blast. He bled to death on the sidewalk, and the last thing he probably felt was excruciating pain from the force of the blast twisting his internal organs. CNN's Patrick Cornell contributed to this report.

"I’ll illustrate that below with two simple examples to give you a sense of what “low utilization” means.

If you have a somewhat low utilization application, it’s not even close: Lambda is dramatically cheaper.

But these numbers can be a little hard to wrap your head around… just how does this pricing compare to EC2 costs? Who is the winner of the AWS Lambda vs EC2 Cost Comparison? Of course, the answer is all about utilization.

A typical AWS serverless stack has several cost components: Lambda , API Gateway, DynamoDB , and often S3 & CloudFront . In this post we’ll focus on Lambda and reviewing if the AWS Lambda cost is expensive.

There are many compelling reasons to consider a Serverless / Lambda-based architecture for your next project: scalability, fault-tolerance, low maintenance cost, high flexibility. But one of the most often-cited is cost.

Low Utilization Pricing Comparison: Lambda Cost vs. EC2 Cost

Lightweight and low-traffic website

10,000 hits/day

perhaps 200 ms of execution time per hit at 256MB

→ 432,000 requests per month and 2160 GB-sec of compute per month

→ about $0.31/mo

… less than 1/10th the cost of even a t2.nano, the smallest EC2 instance!

Periodic Scheduled Job

A scheduled job that runs every hour with 1GB RAM for 2 minutes

→ 86,400 GB-sec of compute per month and 720 requests per month

→ $1.44/mo

… still less than 1/3rd of a t2.nano!

(And a t2.nano only gives you 0.5GB of RAM, so this type of job wouldn’t even be possible on it.)

Bigger Workloads - Lambda Breakeven Analysis

The story is less obvious for bigger workloads. One approach here is to look at the break-even utilization rate:

How much compute would your EC2 instance have to do to be cheaper than Lambda for that same workload?

For comparison, we’ll use a typical workhorse instance, the m4.large instance type. It has 2 vCPU and 8 GB RAM and costs $0.12/hr or approx $86/month in the N. Virginia region.

Lambda Breakeven Analysis for an m4.large Instance

Function Execution Memory & Time Requests per Hour Required for Lambda Cost to Equal EC2 Cost Requests per Second 100 ms @ 128 MB 295,000 81.9 200 ms @ 512 MB 64,000 17.8 200 ms @ 1 GB 34,000 9.4 1 sec @ 1 GB 7,100 2.0

So what does this mean? If a typical transaction in your application takes 100 milliseconds to run and uses 128 MB of RAM, your m4.large instance (with 2 vCPU and 8 GB RAM) would need to be running 82 requests per second, every second of every day, before it is more cost effective than running the same workload on Lambda. Could a single m4.large even handle 82 requests per second? Well of course that depends greatly on the workload, but typically that would be quite a lot.

On the other end of the spectrum, if your typical transaction is long-running (1 second execution time) and needs a full 1 GB of RAM for each transaction, then it would take 2 requests per second, every second of every day, on an m4.large with two vCPUs and 8 GB of RAM total, before EC2 is more cost effective. Again, whether or not that is reasonable depends greatly on your individual workload, but it gives you a sense of how heavily loaded your EC2 instance would need to be before it is more cost effective than Lambda.

This is a simple analysis with a lot of caveats (storage costs for EC2 are ignored, reservation savings are ignored), but it is meant to illustrate the general point… it takes a LOT of compute volume, more than one would typically run on an instance with 2 vCPUs and 8 GB of RAM, before Lambda costs are similar to EC2 costs.

And of course, we’re completely ignoring total cost of ownership here. There is no autoscaling or clustering or load balancing to build & manage, no containers to create and ship, no security patching. So even if the Lambda pricing is more expensive than EC2, in some cases, there is still a strong case for using it.

Summary

Keep these two points in mind:

For most periodic or very light workloads, Lambda is dramatically less expensive than even the smallest EC2 instances.

Focus on the memory and execution time that a typical transaction in your app will need to relate a given instance size to the break-even Lambda cost.

So now get out there and create some Lambda functions! And hit us up on Twitter if you’ve got any good ideas on how to analyze Lambda pricing.

In this comprehensive guide, we cover how to start a vegetable garden from scratch, which vegetables to grow, and when to plant what. We’ve also added a “starter” garden plan consisting of easy-to-grow vegetables, companion planting techniques, and some lovely flowers!

Vegetable Gardening for Beginners

Why garden, you ask? How about enjoying the best vegetables and fruit you’ve ever eaten? If you’ve never tasted garden-fresh food, you will be amazed by the sweet, juicy flavors and vibrant textures. There’s absolutely nothing quite like fresh veggies, especially if you grow them yourself—which you can!

It may seem daunting at first, but gardening is a very rewarding hobby. On this page, we’ll highlight the basics of vegetable gardening and planning: how to pick the right site for your garden, how to create the right-size garden, and how to select which vegetables to grow.

Pick the Right Location

Picking a good location for your garden is absolutely key. A subpar location can result in subpar veggies! Here are a few tips for choosing a good site:

Sunny spot: Most vegetables need 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight per day. A few veggies (mostly leafy ones) will tolerate some shade.

Drains well and doesn’t stay wet: If you have poorly drained soil where water pools, plant veggies in a raised bed or raised row for improved drainage. Wet soil means wet roots, which can turn into rotted roots. If you have rocky soil, till and remove the rocks, as they will interfere with root growth and make for weaker plants.

If you have poorly drained soil where water pools, plant veggies in a raised bed or raised row for improved drainage. Wet soil means wet roots, which can turn into rotted roots. If you have rocky soil, till and remove the rocks, as they will interfere with root growth and make for weaker plants. Stable and not windy: Avoid places that receive strong winds that could knock over your young plants or keep pollinators from doing their job. Nor do you want to plant in a location that receives too much foot traffic or floods easily. Plant in a location that would make Goldilocks smile—somewhere that’s “just right.”

Avoid places that receive strong winds that could knock over your young plants or keep pollinators from doing their job. Nor do you want to plant in a location that receives too much foot traffic or floods easily. Plant in a location that would make Goldilocks smile—somewhere that’s “just right.” Nutrient-rich soil. Your soil feeds your plants. You’ll have poor, unhealthy plants if you have thin, nutrient-poor soil. Mix in plenty of organic matter to help your plants grow. See how to prepare your soil for vegetable plants.

Choosing a Plot Size: Start Small!

Remember: It’s better to be proud of a small garden than be frustrated by a big one!

One of the most common errors that beginners make is planting too much too soon—way more than anybody could ever eat or want! Unless you want to have zucchinis taking up residence in your attic, plan your garden with care. Start small, and only grow what you know you and your family will eat.

Size of Garden

If planting in the ground, a 10’ x 10’ garden (100 square feet) is a manageable size. Pick 3 to 5 of your favorite vegetables and buy 3 to 5 plants of each one.

If planting in a raised bed, a 4’ x 4’ or 4’ x 8’ is a good beginner size. See our Raised Garden Bed Guide, which covers the benefits of raised beds, how to build a raised bed, and what type of soil to fill a raised bed with.

If you want to go bigger, a 12’ x 24’ garden in the ground is probably the biggest a first-timer should go. For example, a garden that feeds a family of four could include 3 hills of yellow squash, 1 mound of zucchini, 10 assorted peppers, 6 tomato plants, 12 okra plants, a 12-foot row of bush beans, 2 cucumbers on a cage, 2 eggplants, 6 basil, 1 rosemary, and a few low-growing herbs such as oregano, thyme, and marjoram.

Whatever the size of your garden: Every four feet or so, make sure that you have paths that allow you to access your plants to weed and harvest. Just ensure you can reach the center of the row or bed easily without stepping on the soil.

Choosing Vegetables

As a beginner, start by choosing easy vegetables that are also productive. We’ve listed some of the easiest vegetables for beginners below. Most are best started by seeds planted directly into the soil, unless noted.



However, it would also be wise to contact your state’s Cooperative Extension Service to find out what plants grow best in your area. For example, if you live in an area with extremely hot weather, vegetables that prefer cooler temps may struggle.

Top 10 Easiest Vegetables to Grow

(Tip: Click on a veggie’s name to see its detailed Growing Guide.)

Mix in flowers such as marigolds—which discourage pests, attract pollinators, and add some color!

Five tips for choosing vegetables:

Choose what you (and your family) like to eat. If no one likes Brussels sprouts, don’t bother planting them! But if your kids love green beans, put more effort into growing a big crop of beans. Be realistic about how many vegetables your family will eat. Be careful not to overplant, as you will only stretch yourself thin by trying to take care of tons of plants! (Of course, you could always give excess veggies away to friends, family, or the local soup kitchen.) Consider the availability of veggies at your grocery store. Maybe you want to grow tomatillos instead of cabbage or carrots, which are readily available in your area. Also, certain veggies are so far superior when homegrown, it’s almost a shame not to consider them (we’re thinking of garden lettuce and tomatoes). Also, homegrown herbs are far less expensive than grocery-store herbs. Be prepared to take care of your plants throughout the growing season. Going on a summer vacation? Remember that tomatoes and zucchinis grow strongest in the middle of summer. If you’ll be gone for part of the summer, you need someone to look after the crops, or they will suffer. Or, you could just grow cool-season crops such as lettuce, kale, peas, and root veggies during the cooler months of late spring and early fall. Use high-quality seeds. Seed packets are less expensive than individual plants, but if seeds don’t germinate, your money—and time—are wasted. A few extra cents spent in spring for that year’s seeds will pay off in higher yields at harvest time.

Where and When to Plant

If you are simply growing two or three tomato plants, this process is easy. But if you plan to grow a full garden, you need to consider:

Where will each plant go?

When will each vegetable need to be planted?

Here are a few guidelines for arranging your vegetables:

Not all vegetables are planted at the same time. ”Cool-season” vegetables such as lettuce, broccoli, and peas grow in the cooler weather of early spring (and fall). “Warm-season” vegetables such as tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers aren’t planted until the soil warms up in late spring and summer.

Plant tall veggies (such as pole beans on a trellis or sweet corn) on the north side of the garden so they don’t shade shorter plants. If you do get shade in a part of your garden, save that area for small, cool-season veggies. If shade is unavoidable in parts of your garden, save those areas for cool-season vegetables that appreciate shade as the weather heats up.

Most veggies are annuals (planted each year). If you’re planning on growing “perennial” crops such as asparagus, rhubarb, and some herbs, provide permanent locations or beds.

Consider that some crops mature quickly and have a very short harvest period (radishes, bush beans). Other plants, such as tomatoes, take longer to produce, but also produce for longer. These “days to maturity” are typically listed on the seed packet.

Stagger plantings. You don’t want to plant all your lettuce seeds at the same time, or all that lettuce will need to be harvested at around the same time! Stagger plantings by a few weeks to keep ‘em coming!

When to Plant What

Every region has a different planting time based mainly on the weather, and every vegetable has its temperature preferences, too. See the Almanac’s Best Planting Dates—a gardening calendar customized to your local frost dates. Just enter your zip code (or postal code in Canada)!

For specific planting information, see our individual Grow Guides for over 100 popular vegetables, herbs, and fruit. For each crop, we provide specific information about how to plant, grow, and harvest, including watering and fertilizing, and pest control!

A Starter Beginner Garden Plan

To help out beginners, we thought that it may be useful to see a garden design. Here is an example of a starter family garden using the common easy-to-grow vegetables listed above. It also features companion planting (the practice of placing plants that thrive together next to each other).

You’ll see that we have given the garden decent-sized paths and mixed in a few herbs and flowers, too. Frankly, if we had grown this garden in our very first year, we would be thrilled! In planning the garden this way, we have made it so much easier for you to succeed with it.

Garden Planning Tool

The Old Farmer’s Almanac offers an excellent online garden planning tool that makes your garden planning fun and easy. With this tool, draw your garden plan on the computer and drop in your preferred vegetables, and it automatically calculates the proper spacing for each type of crop! This way, you don’t waste seeds or crowd your plants. The Garden Planner automatically pulls in the frost dates for your specific location, identifies easy vegetables, and even identifies companion plants. Then you can print out your plan, and the tool reminds you of your seeding and harvesting dates for every vegetable!

Plus, you’ll see many free garden plans for inspiration! Over time, you’ll see that this tool also provides “crop rotation” so that if you plan a second season, you can properly reposition your plants to avoid pests and disease.

With new gardeners in mind, we offer a FREE week to try the Garden Planner—ample time to plan your first garden.

This place can be peaceful at certain times of the day, like a Sunday...early evening. \nThe decor inside is super artsy and does help one to leave the daily grind in a different way. The environment really is different inside, in a cool way. I hope to eat inside again, when it feels more comfortable.\nI have mixed feelings about the plates here. I haven't loved my combination plates, but my burritos have been very satisfying! Right now my favorite item on the menu is the Chile Relleno Burrito. The cheese chile relleno is fresh, huge and delicious. I like the moist rice within the burrito, and delicious beans as well. I'm curious to try the house-made mole, chile verde and torta in the future. This is a very unique restaurant. They serve unsweetened mango iced tea as well! Our server was very nice, and refilled our drinks. For now, I will stick to takeout and the patio, until it feels safer to eat inside. That Chile Relleno burrito is comfort food with some nice salsa.""}]}",The restaurant offers a casual ambience and is known for its unique decor.,1,0,0.04740743339061737

"[1] One theory is that the rings formed at the same time as the planet and its major moons. In this case, if material is close to the planet, the planet’s gravitational pull is too strong to coalesce into a moon and the particles that would otherwise form a moon spread out in orbit around the planet as a ring.Another idea is that a close call by a moon or comet results in the planet’s gravitational tidal force breaking up those bodies, the debris of which then becomes a ring system.

[2] The answer seems to be that there are small moons orbiting ringed planets at or near the distance from the planets as the rings themselves, and that these moons are needed to keep the rings from flying apart. So, basically, having enough moons the right distance from the planet makes rings possible.

[3] At present, scientists aren’t entirely sure how these ring systems came about. They may have formed from leftover material from the formation of the planet, or be the remains of a moon that was destroyed by an impact or simply broken apart by the gravitational force of the parent planet.

[4] Scientists are also unsure why only the gas giants have rings. They think it may be related to the same process that resulted in gas giants forming only in the outer Solar System while rocky planets formed only in the inner Solar System. It is thought that the energy given off by the infant Sun expelled most of the light gases and other volatile molecules from the inner regions of the Solar System, leaving heavier elements able to form inner rocky planets. This process also seems to have made it easier for the outer planets to form moons.
So, the combination of large gravitational forces, the existence of volatile materials such as ices and the shepherding of material by numerous moons probably mean the outer planets were far more likely to form and keep planetary rings.","For example, if a planet is surrounded by dust and small particles, it is likely to form rings as the particles are too small to coalesce into a moon.",0,0,0.04872037470340729

"Texas once again heads to court — this time trying to stop feds from cutting razor wire at border
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is back in action, filing suit against the Biden administration Tuesday, hoping to stop federal agents from cutting razor wire at the border.
In the suit, Paxton alleges that the White House is ""undermining"" efforts by the state to ensure security amid record numbers of immigrants coming to the Texas border.
“Texas has the sovereign right to construct border barriers to prevent the entry of illegal aliens,” Paxton said in a press release.
Environmental and immigration advocates have raised concerns about the razor wire at the border and its implications for the environment and human safety, according to the Associated Press.
The ""concertina wire"" barriers have reportedly injured migrants as they have tried to cross into Texas along the Rio Grande in border cities such as Brownsville and Eagle Pass. In some cases, federal agents have had to cut the wire to free to the migrants caught in it, according to the AP.
The state has repeatedly butted heads and gone to court with the federal government as efforts ramp up to curtail illegal crossings at the Texas-Mexico border. The Department of Justice sued Texas in July to try to force Gov. Greg Abbott to remove buoys meant to block migrants from crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. Abbott then claimed the buoys were the Border Patrol's idea, and plans to restart construction on border walls along the Rio Grande.
“We allege that Texas has flouted federal law by installing a barrier in the Rio Grande without obtaining the required federal authorization,” Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta said in a statement regarding the lawsuit.
“This floating barrier poses threats to navigation and public safety and presents humanitarian concerns,” Gupta said.
Abbott shot back this week, saying the Biden administration is breaking the law by trying to take down border barriers.
“Americans across the country were horrified to watch Biden’s open-border policy in action: agents were physically cutting wires and assisting the aliens’ entry into our state,” he said in a statement. “This is illegal. It puts our country and our citizens at risk. The courts must put a stop to it, or Biden’s free-for-all will make this crushing immigration crisis even worse.”","Environmental and immigration advocates have raised concerns about the razor wire, citing its impact on the environment and human safety.",1,1,0.9628295302391052

""She moved towards shops overlooking the bus station as if she was going to buy something and disappeared. Moments later the bag exploded and set the bus on fire, killing five people and inujuring around 15 others,"" Tasiu said. Although no one has claimed responsibility for the attack, Boko Haram Islamists have repeatedly carried out suicide and bombing attacks on bus stations and markets in Gombe and other northern cities, making the group the main suspect. Boko Haram has in recent months been under sustained pressure from sweeping offensives from a four-nation regional alliance of Nigeria, Chad, Niger and Cameroon. The regional offensives have considerably weakened Boko Haram's capabilities, which has prompted the Islamists to resort to attacks on soft targets such as bus stations, markets and schools. The explosion was the first attack since Nigeria held its presidential election at the weekend, which was won by opposition candidate Muhammadu Buhari, who vowed to crush Boko Haram when he assumes office in late May.

"Lumbar Puncture

A lumbar puncture (LP) or spinal tap may be done to diagnose or treat a condition. For this procedure, your healthcare provider inserts a hollow needle into the space surrounding the spinal column (subarachnoid space) in the lower back to withdraw some cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or inject medicine. CSF is a clear fluid that bathes and cushions the brain and spinal cord. It is continuously made and reabsorbed in the brain. CSF is made up of cells, water, proteins, sugars, and other substances that are essential to maintain balance in the nervous system. Why might I need a lumbar puncture? A lumbar puncture may be done for various reasons. The most common reason is to remove a small amount of CSF for testing. This can help in the diagnosis of various disorders. The fluid is tested for red and white blood cells, protein, and glucose (sugar). The clarity and color of the fluid are also checked and it is tested to see whether bacteria, viruses, or abnormal cells are present.","Finally, a lumbar puncture should be performed, which will involve measuring the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure, and analyzing the CSF for any signs of infection, inflammation, or abnormal cells.",1,0,0.05264394357800484
"[1] Contact lenses are designed to cover the cornea, the clear covering of the eye. They stay in place by adhering to the tear film of the eye, and through the pressure from the eyelids. When you blink, your eyelid glides over the contact lens, enabling a cleansing and lubricating action to keep the contact lens comfortable on the cornea.

[2] The way that contact lenses stay in place in the eye is by sticking to the layer of the tear fluid on the surface.
This tear fluid floats on your eye at all times and the pressure of your eyelids helps to make the contact lens “stick to it” with lubrication. When you blink, you are providing lubrication and flushing away the impurities that might become stuck on the lens as well.

[3] Your contact lenses can fall out for a variety of reasons, including improper fit and rubbing your eyes too vigorously.",This lubrication helps to keep the contact lens comfortable on the cornea and stops it from moving all over the eye.,1,0,0.07322674244642258
"Speaker 1: Motion carries.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Item 22.
Speaker 1: Report from City Manager. Recommendation to Request City Attorney to prepare a resolution to oppose Proposition six. The voter approval for future gas and vehicle taxes and 2017 tax repeal initiative citywide.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Ringo.
Speaker 2: Yes. Given the importance that SB one has provided for not only the city limits, but for the state as a whole, I think it's very important that we oppose this proposition because it would have a devastating effect on all the projects that we currently have going in the city alone, which because of SB one, and when you look at what's going on with the replacement bridge at the replacement Desmond Bridge, it would be a bridge going to nowhere if we didn't have the funds to finish that project. And we have as well some other projects in Long Beach, including the Long Beach Boulevard and Pacific Coast Highway and a lot of other projects that we have because of SB one. So I would strongly suggest let's just so strongly support the city council opposing measure. I mean, Proposition six.
Speaker 0: Becky, there's a motion and a second seconded by Councilman Austin. Councilman Austin.
Speaker 8: Yes. I'd also like to just weigh in and say, I think it's important for us to to stand by what we've worked for as a council and support it for for several years. It was the Fix Our Roads kind of campaign through the League of California Cities, a lot of our legislative advocacy for infrastructure support and dollars for state highways, but also for local roads as well, that this these dollars actually will go a long way, if I'm not mistaken. Stephanie, can you tell me specifically how much if SB six does pass, how much we would stand to lose as a city?
Speaker 2: Diana Chang.
Speaker 1: Good morning, Mayor.
Speaker 5: And Members of the City Council. SB 145 19 We've budgeted $8 million for.
Speaker 1: Projects in all nine council districts, and so those revenues would would likely.
Speaker 7: Be.
Speaker 5: Repealed and, and the projects would be without.
Speaker 1: A source of dedicated funding.
Speaker 8: So that's that's $8 million annually, correct?
Speaker 1: It's $8 million for FY 19.
Speaker 7: And as the revenues continue to be implemented as part of SB one, we're expecting them to grow to.
Speaker 5: 11 million in about FY 20 and then indexed to inflation thereafter. I would also like to note that this essentially doubles what the city currently receives from the state for streets.
Speaker 3: Streets and.
Speaker 1: Roads.
Speaker 5: Currently with just hooda the traditional source of state funding for streets and roads. Our our budget, it's about 10 million annually. So with SB one, we add another eight for FY19.
Speaker 7: About 11 for FY 20, and then adjusted to inflation every year thereafter.
Speaker 8: So I think it's a the the, the gas tax that we have is a small price to pay for, for good infrastructure investing in our future. The impact would be obviously significant for our public works infrastructure budget. And if we didn't if we lost those dollars, we'd have to be made up elsewhere. We and that would be less dollars that we could actually put toward residential streets, which I think are so important to our residents. And so for those reasons, I support this this motion to support to support or oppose. SB I'm to be very clear to oppose SB six.
Speaker 0: Six and let me add one thing that wasn't, I think unless I missed it in Dana Takes presentation, which is that the SB one not just not only includes all the street work and the annual funding that comes in, but they're also doing specific, larger streets. And part of SB one separate of what we're getting annually this year is the entire reconstruction of PCH from our entrance point in Orange County, all the way through the city to our exit point in in western Long Beach. And so that is a project that the state's doing that's in Long Beach that doesn't count towards our our amount. And so that that's a huge project that is obviously incredibly, incredibly expensive. And so that's why work goes through most of the city. There's a motion of seconds are public comment on this item saying none please cast your votes.","The repeal of SB 145 (gas tax) through Proposition 6 would result in an annual loss of $8 million in funding for infrastructure projects in Long Beach, with an expected increase to $11 million in FY20 and indexed to inflation thereafter.",1,0,0.00759882153943181
"COOPER: It's an argument that would seem right at home on the “Real Housewives of Washington“ except that series ended seasons ago. President Trump's first and third wives are in broiled in a public spat. That after the first wife Ivana called herself the first lady in an interview today. The actual First Lady Melania Trump and felt moved to put out a statement of her own and just a reminder, this all actually happened. Our Randi Kaye breaks it down.
DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: It is Melania.
RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The shot across the bow came from Ivana Trump on “Good Morning America“ this morning.
IVANA TRUMP, FORMER WIFE OF DONALD TRUMP: I have the direct numbers to White House but I no really want to call him there because Melania is there and I don't want to cause any kind of jealousy or something like that, because I'm basically first Trump wife, OK. I'm first lady.
KAYE (voice-over): As you might imagine, Ivana calling herself the first lady didn't sit so well with the real first lady. In a tersely worded statement, First Lady Melania Trump fired back through her spokesperson. “Mrs. Trump has made the White House a home for Barron and the president. She loves living in Washington, D.C., and is honored by her role as first lady of the United States. She plans to use her title and role to help children, not sell books.“ The statement went on to say, “There is clearly no substance to this statement from an ex. This is unfortunately only attention-seeking and self-serving noise.“ That statement certainly a different tone than we heard from Melania Trump back in 2005.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know his exes?
MELANIA TRUMP, UNITED STATES FIRST LADY: Yes.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get along with them?
M. TRUMP: I don't see them much. I don't -- you know, we don't see them --
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They were at the wedding though.
KAYE (voice-over): Ivana Trump and Donald Trump met more than four decades ago and were married eight months later. She is the mother of the president's three eldest children, Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric who would later become his second wife. Over the weekend, Ivana told CBS she doesn't speak to Marla Maples but that she gets along with Melania Trump, explaining her reasoning this way.
I. TRUMP: Ivana's nobody and Ivana his first lady.
KAYE (voice-over): First lady, a title Ivana took for herself just 24 hours later during another network interview. Ivana's shot at first lady ended when her marriage to Donald Trump ended. But as she tells it, she did have a chance at an ambassadorship.
I. TRUMP: I was just offered to be American ambassador to Czech Republic. And Donald told me said, Ivana, if you want it, I give it to you. But I like my freedom, OK. Why would I go and say bye-bye to Miami in the winter, bye-bye to San Tropez in summer? And bye-bye to spring and fall in New York. I have the perfect life.
KAYE (voice-over): The perfect life far from the east wing of the White House. Randi Kaye, CNN, New York.
COOPER: So to really understand what is going on here, I had to call in reinforcements. My friend, Andy Cohen, who is executive producer of the “Real Housewives“ franchise as well as host of all these “Real Housewives“ reunion. Here's part of that conversation.
ANDY COHEN, EXECUTIVE PRODUCE, REAL HOUSEWIVES: I was watching this play out today and just thought, you know what, and I would like to be, you know, I'm here on CNN, open invitation to the first lady, to the honorary first lady Ivana Trump. I'd like to get Marla Maples in there. I think she maybe has unresolved issues. And I feel it would be great to have Ivanka Trump there as well. I will set up two couches, get this going, and just put me in the game, I can do this.
COOPER: We're going have more of my conversation with Andy at the 9:00 hour including tips from Andy's “Housewives“ playbook. Up next the escalating fight between the president and the sitting Republican senator, a powerful sitting Republican senator who says the president is putting the country at risk of World War III.",Melania Trump issued a statement through her spokesperson criticizing Ivana Trump for calling herself the 'first Trump wife' and 'first lady.',1,0,0.13457219302654266
"Despite its humble roots, sous vide cooking has become one of the most celebrated ways of preparing food in commercial kitchens. Part of its popularity is due to the fact that it doesn’t require expensive equipment and can be performed by any member of your staff. If you’re looking for a consistent, easy, and energy-efficient method to prepare food at your restaurant, sous vide is the perfect choice.

If you’re interested in learning about sous vide cooking and incorporating this popular food preparation method into your restaurant, keep reading to learn about the benefits of sous vide, the equipment you’ll need, and how to use it to cook a variety of foods.

What is Sous Vide?

Developed in the mid-1970’s by a French chef, sous vide cooking is now a fixture in many commercial kitchens. Defined as “under vacuum,” sous vide is the process of slow-cooking vacuum sealed food with water set to a specific temperature. This relatively foolproof method will cook everything from steak to fruit and can be executed by any member of your staff. With the proper equipment and basic technical knowledge, your restaurant will soon be producing delicious sous vide dishes.

1. You Can Set It and Forget It

Cooking sous vide gives you the freedom to vacuum pack your food, place it in water, set the temperature, and walk away. Unlike traditional cooking methods where you have to watch and check on your food, items prepared using sous vide will cook to perfection and keep your chef’s hands free for other tasks. Your food will be held at a consistent temperature for long periods of time, and the texture and quality of your ingredients will remain intact. All of these factors make sous vide perfect for busy, high-volume kitchens or foodservice businesses that prefer to prepare food in advance.

2. Overcooking is Virtually Impossible

Another benefit of sous vide cooking is that it is virtually impossible to overcook your food. Sous vide cooks by bringing food up to the water bath’s exact temperature, so your ingredients will be unable to cook at a higher degree than the water’s specified temperature. The immersion circulator also makes it impossible for the water to cool beyond the set temperature, which leads to even and consistent cooking every time. Your food will also retain its moisture and tenderness due to the use of water as a cooking medium. Keep in mind that meat cooked sous vide-style will not brown or crisp, but you can easily achieve this by pre-searing or quickly applying a finishing sear to the food.

3. Reduced Risk of Contamination

The length of time it takes for foods to cook via sous vide also practically eliminates the risk of contamination, as the water essentially pasteurizes your food.

4. Better Taste

Another benefit of cooking via sous vide is that foods retain more of their nutrients and vitamins than ingredients cooked through more traditional methods. Similarly, natural juices remain trapped in the bag with your food, which leads to a marinating effect and enhances their taste.

Necessary Equipment

The first piece of equipment you’ll need to cook sous vide is an immersion circulator, which will keep your cooking water at a constant temperature. Immersion circulators also feature adjustable clamps that easily attach to your water bath. You can use a plastic food box or any storage tub to hold the water you’ll use to sous vide.

You’ll also need a commercial vacuum sealer and vacuum sealer bags. To package your food, simply place it into the bag, use the machine to suck out any extra air, and seal it tightly. Most vacuum packaging bags are made of polyethylene, which is considered a safe plastic. Be sure to avoid cheaper plastic wraps, though, which are often made of PVC and can leach chemicals into your food. At this point, you are ready to place your food into the water bath and set the cooking time and temperature.

What Can I Cook Using Sous Vide?

While sous vide works best for cooking meat and fish due to their lower required cooking temperature, you can also use sous vide to cook a variety of other foods. These include (but are not limited to) eggs, french fries, vegetables, fruits, and infused alcohols and oils. If you’re looking for sous vide recipes or cookbooks, we recommend the following:

Infusing Foods Before Sous Vide Cooking

Many chefs use sous vide methods to infuse oils, alcohol, and other liquid with creative and unique flavors. For example, you could combine spices or herbs with alcohol, vacuum seal it into a bag, and prepare it sous vide style at a high temperature for quick and easy infusion. Infused liquids should be allowed to heat in the water bath for 1 to 2 hours; once removed, you should place the bag in an ice bath for at least 15 minutes. To finish, strain your liquid and store it in a sealed container. You can also add dry or liquid condiments to food during vacuum packing for enhanced infusion and marination.

Incorporating Sous Vide Cooking Into Your Restaurant

While fine dining chefs have been using sous vide for years, it has also made its way into the chain and fast-casual restaurant segment. For example, Chipotle uses sous vide to enhance its carnitas and barbacoa. Your chef may also find it handy to sous vide foods beforehand, keep them in their individual vacuum bags in the refrigerator, and finish them with a quick sear right before serving.

Sous vide is also a smart choice when preparing daily or weekly menu specials. While you might feel more comfortable preparing your most popular menu items via traditional cooking techniques, sous vide could be the perfect way to craft special dishes or new menu items. Sous vide cooking is also more energy-efficient than cooking with most ovens and ranges, which will help your business save money on energy costs.",Healthier result**: The food preserves more of its nutrients and vitamins than other cooking methods.,1,0,0.010827131569385529
"New York (CNN)A New York Police Department detective apologized Friday for an angry exchange with an Uber driver that was caught on video and landed him on modified assignment. ""I apologize. I sincerely apologize,"" Patrick Cherry told WNBC's Jonathan Dienst. Cherry, an NYPD detective assigned to the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force with top-secret security clearance, faces suspension, reassignment or loss of his clearance after the video of the altercation went viral. ""I was just angry, at that moment, for that exchange."" Cherry said. ""If the conversation initially went differently, we probably would have shook hands at the end of that encounter."" The altercation began Monday when the Uber driver gestured to a detective in an unmarked car to use his blinker after he was allegedly attempting to park without using it, according to Sanjay Seth, a passenger in the car who uploaded the video to YouTube. The video picks up seconds after the detective began yelling at the driver and mocking his accent, and also shows the unmarked car with lights flashing pulled over behind the Uber car. In the video, the detective tells the driver he has committed ""three traffic and law violations""  and then becomes irate and uses expletives toward the comparably calm driver. A visibly upset Police Commissioner William Bratton on Wednesday said the detective was placed on modified assignment pending an investigation. ""No good cop can watch that without a wince,"" he told reporters. ""As all good cops know ... the officer made their jobs a little bit harder. That kind of anger like that is unacceptable in any encounter; discourtesy like that and language like that is unacceptable. That officer's behavior reflected poorly on everyone who wears our uniform."" Cherry also apologized to the police commissioner, saying ""he's doing a lot of good work to strengthen community relations in the city and I set that back. I would work, personally work to fix that."" ""You can't judge three minutes of a tape involving me and me alone as indication that that's the kind of practice of the New York City Police Department,"" he added. Bratton, who said the detective was on duty at the time, issued an apology to the driver and passengers. Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters at an unrelated news conference that he had not seen the video. ""There's just no place for any public servant to use discriminatory or negative language,"" he said. ""Obviously, our police play a particularly sensitive role and need to show respect for all people."" In a statement, Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives' Endowment Association, called the officer ""a person of good character and an excellent detective"" who ""should not be judged by one isolated incident."" ""I am not trying to minimize the significance of what occurred,"" Palladino said. ""I am simply pointing out that cops are just like everyone else. They have families, friends and other things going on in their lives, too, that may affect their behavior at times. There is no disputing that we are held to a higher standard, that is why this incident is so newsworthy."" In the video, after the detective steps back to his car, the Uber driver, who moved to America less than two years ago, turns to the passenger and thanks him for recording the video. ""That's crazy. That's really inappropriate,"" the passenger tells the driver. ""Listen, it's not your fault. He shouldn't be slamming your car door, throwing things around. He doesn't have a right to open your door."" When the detective comes back, he is irate and doesn't allow the driver to speak. ""I don't care what you have to say, people are allowed to park their cars on the side of the street without your interference,"" the detective tells the driver. ""I don't know where you're coming from, where you think it's appropriate in doing that. That's the way it works."" ""I've got news for you,"" the detective says, ""the only reason you're not in handcuffs and going to jail and getting summons in the precinct is because I have things to do. That's the only reason that's not happening. Because this isn't important enough for me. You're not important enough. Don't ever do that again."" The NYPD said the Internal Affairs Bureau is investigating the incident. ""The behavior in the video is wrong and unacceptable and we appreciate the NYPD investigating the incident. We are in touch with our driver-partner who was subjected to this terrible experience and will continue to provide any support he needs,"" Uber said Tuesday. Seth met Wednesday with an investigator from the Civilian Complaint Review Board, according to board spokeswoman Linda Sachs. The investigator is attempting to interview the driver as well as the police officer. The findings will be presented to the board, which will make an official determination on whether misconduct was committed, Sachs said. The board will either refer the decision to the NYPD with a disciplinary recommendation, or decide to bring up the officer on administrative charges, with the decision presented to the police commissioner. CNN's Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.

"They come from more than 20 countries, drawn to Libya as the funnel to Europe. Eritreans want to escape repression or military service; Somalis flee Al-Shabaab and clan warfare; Syrians have given up hope of returning home. In villages in Senegal and elsewhere across West Africa, young men sell all they have in the hope of a better life in Europe, perhaps hoping to join a cousin or brother who made it. Motivations among the tens of thousands making the trek to the Mediterranean coast are as many and varied as the nationalities involved, according to researchers and human rights groups. But in 2014 more than 80% of them headed for the Libyan coast as the easiest point of embarkation. From the Horn of Africa to the Atlantic, from Syria and Gaza, these would-be migrants travel well-established smuggling routes. Along the way they must cross deserts and mountains, risk kidnap or robbery, are often cheated or left stranded. One African migrant reported surviving on toothpaste for days. A teenage Somali who made it to Malta told researchers that he had warned other family members not to come. ""I tell them its 95% sure that you will die,"" he said. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has tracked the migrant flows through North Africa for years. Eritreans have long been prominent among the travelers, escaping an authoritarian government, poverty and indefinite military service -- a land without possibilities. ""Many conscripts are not demobilized from the military as scheduled and some were forced to serve indefinitely under threats of detention, torture, or punishment of their families,"" according to a report by the Regional Mixed Migration Secretariat (RMMS) in Nairobi last year. They travel to Sudan, so long as they can avoid kidnap by tribes on the border, and are handed from one group of smugglers to the next in relay. One Eritrean woman told the UN Refugee agency (UNHCR) this month that she had paid $5,000 to reach the Mediterranean. Eritreans and Syrians made up half of the migrant traffic to Europe last year, according to Arezo Malakooti, director of migration research at Altai Consulting and author of one of the most detailed studies of migration patterns. Malakooti has recently visited seven countries, including Libya, Tunisia and Morocco to update her study. The ""push factor"" is much greater than the ""pull"" of Europe, she says. Upheavals and instability across much of Africa and the Middle East -- combined with the perception that Libya's doors are open -- have led to a massive increase in the numbers trying to reach Libya. ""Worsening repression in Eritrea"" has been one factor, she says -- while Eritreans already in refugee camps in Sudan have decided to make a dash for the Mediterranean. One reason is that other routes -- through Saudi Arabia and to Israel -- have become more difficult: Israel has adopted a much tougher approach on would-be Eritrean migrants trying to enter the country through the Sinai desert, including detention, and Yemen's implosion has cut off that conduit. As one Eritrean told the humanitarian journal IRIN last year: ""People were traveling to Israel because it was the only way, and now they're traveling to Europe because it's the only way."" Somalis, often seen as the third most numerous nationality among migrants headed to the Mediterranean, face a perfect storm of crises. ""Extreme poverty; prolonged insecurity; sexual violence and other serious human rights violations; lack of access to basic needs such as food, medical services, healthcare and livelihoods"" are all contributory factors, says the RMMS. Sea-tossed storm of human misery hits Italian shores. The IOM told CNN it is seeing a spike in would-be migrants from Senegal, Mali, Guinea and Gambia in West Africa. Many reason that Libya's chaos is an opportunity: border posts are left abandoned, the coastline unguarded. Most West Africans make the journey for economic reasons; the majority are single men in their twenties. Populations in the region are swelling but farmland and economic security shrinking. Often, say researchers, the oldest son leaves to find work so he can remit funds home -- perhaps misled by fables of riches. Malakooti noted in a recent report that ""unrealistic expectations of their migration is fueled by migrants in destination who rarely send negative news home because of the pressure on them to succeed."" But West Africans who have sold livestock or other possessions only to be caught or stranded can face destitution when they return home: 400 Senegalese were recently repatriated from Libya by the Red Cross and IOM. Malians have the added incentive of the recent conflict in which jihadist groups seized nearly half the country before French-led intervention pushed them back. Joel Millman of the IOM says there's also been an increase in the number of Nigerian Christians following this route, escaping the chaos and brutality inflicted on their towns and villages by Boko Haram. Another disturbing phenomenon, according to Malakooti, is the trafficking of African women for prostitution to Italy through Libya. While still a small fraction of the overall migration, the number of women smuggled for sexual exploitation in Europe rose threefold in 2014, she says. Why migrants are risking their lives to reach Italy. A Geneva-based group, the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, estimated last year that about half of West African migrants pass through the town of Agadez in northern Niger. A crackdown in 2013 on organized convoys leaving Agadez stemmed the flow for a while, but gangs from the Toubou tribe, which controls the cross-border trade, developed new routes and raised their prices. A migrant might pay as much as $300 to reach southern Libya in a truck or pick-up, according to researchers. Reliable figures on the numbers passing through Agadez are difficult to come by, but the consensus among experts is somewhere between 2,000 and 7,000 every month. Other hubs include Khartoum in Sudan, a way-station for migrants from East Africa, and Tamanrasset in southern Algeria, where a fake Malian passport aids passage. Algeria has also been a destination for Syrian refugees, but new visa requirements have forced them to seek other routes -- often through Turkey and the Greek islands. Hundreds of thousands of other migrants have already been in Libya for years, attracted to jobs as day laborers when Moammar Gadhafi was in power. Now they face violence, discrimination and religious persecution -- and are unable even to remit home what little they earn. So at least some are embarking on a journey to Europe they never intended to take. Malakooti believes this is a major factor in the rising numbers trying to reach Europe. The recent murder of Egyptian and Ethiopian Christians by ISIS's Libyan affiliate may have hastened the departure of some. A similar dynamic applies to Syrian refugees. ""Initially, they remained in Lebanon, Jordan and other neighboring countries to wait out the conflict,"" says Malakooti. Now they've given up, or the resources to accommodate them have evaporated -- and have decided to try to reach Europe and start over. Within Libya, the smugglers for the most part appear to be small groups or individuals rather than large networks, according to human rights organizations. They cluster in dusty towns such as Sabha and Qatrun and use what are known as 'connection houses.' How is Europe going to tackle migrant crisis. Those driving migrants to Tripoli may have no connection with gangs at the coast. Such a journey, across the desert to avoid checkpoints, might cost a migrant $200: in a failed state that sort of cash quickly generates armed rivalries. Tribal feuds, roaming militias and criminal gangs mean migrants need the skills of a smuggler. The arrival of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in Libya has further complicated passage; in January jihadists killed 14 Libyan soldiers near Sabha. Malakooti detects a changing pattern since the Syrian conflict began. It has injected more money into the smuggling business, which has therefore become more organized. The more reliable groups can charge more; she says some migrants buy a ""package"" from smugglers that includes overland and sea travel. Syrian migrants are relatively better off than West Africans, and may pay more to guarantee a place on the top deck of a vessel. Africans are more often locked in the hold and are more vulnerable if a vessel sinks, or consigned to an inflatable dinghy. Fearing arrest, the smugglers rarely travel on the boats themselves, instead giving a compass or GPS device to the migrants, who then set off with no navigational skills and often no experience of the sea in boats that should never have left port. As Libya becomes more dangerous for migrants, other countries on both sides of the Mediterranean are looking on anxiously. Some West Africans opt to travel through Morocco -- even though the chances of detection there are much greater and the sea crossing to Spain very difficult. ""A migrant might need 50 or 60 attempts before making it to the Spanish coast,"" says Malakooti. Tunisia has massively increased security along its eastern border with Libya; both Algeria and Morocco have begun building fences along their border -- against both terrorism and clandestine migration. But they may be little deterrent. The Eritrean writer Abu Bakr Khaal made the desperate voyage to and across the Mediterranean himself. In his novel ""African Titanics,"" he describes the ""dangerous lure"" of escape. Only too late do the migrants discover a grim reality at sea:. ""'If God loved me he would not have brought me here,' groaned one of the passengers. Assured he had uttered the most fitting farewell to life, he threw himself into the sea. The boat moved forward at the whim of the waves."" Meet the couple on a mission to save drowning migrants.
","Many West Africans make the journey for economic reasons, often leaving behind impoverished communities and seeking employment opportunities to support their families.",1,0,0.02538740076124668
"A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit. Stephen Munden, 54, described as having a 'fanatical obsession' with small girls after he targeted a toddler on a bus, has been missing since 6.15pm on Tuesday and was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire. Now officers have launched a manhunt to find Munden  - who was detained under the Mental Health Act after sexually touching the three-year-old girl. A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit. Stephen Munden, 54, (pictured with and without a beard) was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire . He is described as about 5ft 8ins tall, of a heavy build, and has dark hair. Officers said they believed that Munden, who suffers from learning difficulties, may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital in Winchfield and have released images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave. He was detained at the private facility under a hospital order following his sentence last August for sexual offences. Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13. A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court. During the sentencing David Jenkins, prosecuting, told Judge Peter Henry that the defendant had admitted ten unrelated offences of possessing or attempting to possess indecent images of children. The court heard he had been arrested after using one of the public computers at Hythe library in an attempt to download images. Mr Jenkins said children's clothes, books and dolls were found at Munden's home and added: 'He has a fanatical obsession with young girls.' A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court . Consultant physiatrist John O'Shea said the defendant was autistic and also suffered from mild learning difficulties. He added that Munden had difficulty controlling his sexual interest in small children but the girl on the bus was probably unaware of his intentions. Keely Harvey, in mitigation, said: 'He did not accept that he deliberately touched the child's hand.' But the judge said 'the move from non-contact offences to a contact offence is significant' and he was made the subject of a hospital order. Detective Chief Inspector Tim Rowlandson said: 'We are extremely keen to hear from anyone who has seen this man since yesterday evening or knows where he might be. 'Mr Munden is subject to a hospital order after being convicted and sentenced for sexual offences and also suffers from learning difficulties, so we need to know where he is as a matter of urgency.'","stephen munden, 54, last seen leaving a hospital, near hook, hampshire . he was detained at the private facility under a hospital order . munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13 . described as having a 'fanatical obsession' with small girls after he targeted a toddler on a bus .",1,1,0.7749854922294617
"Hey, look what I did. That small boast on social media can trigger a whirlwind that spins into real-life grief, as a Texas veterinarian found out after shooting a cat. Dr. Kristen Lindsey allegedly shot an arrow into the back of an orange tabby's head and posted a proud photo this week on Facebook of herself smiling, as she dangled its limp body by the arrow's shaft. Lindsey added a comment, CNN affiliate KBTX reported. ""My first bow kill, lol. The only good feral tomcat is one with an arrow through it's head! Vet of the year award ... Gladly accepted."" Callers rang the phones hot at Washington County's Animal Clinic, where Lindsey worked, to vent their outrage. Web traffic crashed its website. High price of public shaming on the Internet. Then an animal rescuer said that Lindsey's prey was probably not a feral cat but the pet of an elderly couple, who called him ""Tiger."" He had gone missing on Wednesday, the same day that Lindsey posted the photo of the slain cat. CNN has not been able to confirm the claim. As the firestorm grew, Lindsey wrote in the comments underneath her post: ""no I did not lose my job. Lol. Psshh. Like someone would get rid of me. I'm awesome!"" That prediction was wrong. The clinic fired Lindsey, covered her name on its marquee with duct tape, and publicly distanced itself from her actions. ""Our goal now is to go on and try to fix our black eye and hope that people are reasonable and understand that those actions don't anyway portray what we're for here at Washington Animal Clinic,"" said Dr. Bruce Buenger. ""We put our heart and soul into this place."" The clinic told WBTX that Lindsey was not available for comment. CNN is reaching out to her. She removed her controversial post then eventually shut down her Facebook page. Callers also complained to the Brenham Police Department and Washington County Animal Control, as her Facebook post went viral. The sheriff's office in Austin County, where the cat was apparently shot, is investigating, and Lindsey could face charges. Its dispatchers were overloaded with calls, the sheriff posted on Facebook. ""We are asking you to please take it easy on our dispatchers. As soon as the investigation is complete, we will post the relevant information here on this page,"" the post read. Animal rights activists are pushing for charges. ""Animal cruelty must be taken seriously, and the guilty parties should be punished to the fullest extent of the law,"" said cat advocacy activist Becky Robinson. Her organization, Alley Cat Allies, is offering a $7,500 reward for evidence leading to the arrest and conviction of the person who shot the cat. But others stood up for Lindsey. ""She's amazing. She's caring,"" said customer Shannon Stoddard. ""She's a good vet, so maybe her bad choice of posting something on Facebook was not good. But I don't think she should be judged for it."" She dropped off balloons at the animal clinic for Lindsey with a thank you note. CNN's Jeremy Grisham contributed to this report.

"Former FBI agent and D.C. real estate developer sentenced for bribery scheme
This article may contain AI-assisted content.
The US Attorney's Office in D.C. announced today that a former FBI special agent and a renowned D.C. real estate developer have been sentenced following their involvement in an extensive bribery scheme. The scheme was tied to the unauthorized sharing of confidential data from the D.C. Department of Housing and Community Development.
Key Points
Main Defendants
David Paitsel, 42, a former FBI agent from North Carolina
Brian Bailey, 53, a D.C. real estate developer from Upper Marlboro, Maryland
Bailey was convicted of paying significant sums to Dawne Dorsey, a program specialist with the D.C. Department of Housing and Community Development. In return, Dorsey provided Bailey with confidential and un-redacted Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act (TOPA) offer of sale notices.
These TOPA notices are critical, offering D.C. tenants the right to buy their residence if an owner plans to sell. Some of these notices include private details not publicly available.
In another component of the bribery scheme, Bailey paid Paitsel to retrieve the contact information of tenants with TOPA rights. Paitsel had exclusive access to this data due to his position as an FBI agent.
Sentencing
Paitsel received a sentence of 24 months in prison on each count (to run concurrently), 24 months of supervised release, a $100 special assessment, and was ordered to pay a $10,600 forfeiture money judgment.
Bailey was handed a sentence of 48 months in prison on each count (to run concurrently), 24 months of supervised release, a $100 special assessment, and a substantial $250,000 fine.
Other Parties Involved
Dawne Dorsey, 40, had already pleaded guilty to her role in the bribery in June 2019. Her sentencing is set for November 6, 2023.
In a connected case, Frederick Silvers from Washington, D.C., admitted his guilt over bribery and received a 5-month prison sentence for bribes given to Dorsey.",Other individuals involved have also pleaded guilty and received sentences.,1,1,0.9635657668113708

If you don't mind waiting a few years for your peach tree to bear fruit, growing your own peach tree from seed is a rewarding experience. All you need to do is eat a peach, save the pit, and follow these steps.
- 1. Carefully crack open a peach pit and remove the kernel . A hammer and a nutcracker are both sufficient cracking tools. You can plant the entire pit without cracking it open first, but the seed germinates faster when the pit's outer shell is removed.
- 2. Place the peach pit kernel into a plastic bag . Fill the bag with slightly moist potting soil. Seal the bag.
- 3. Place the plastic bag in your refrigerator . The refrigerator induces the seed’s germination process through cold stratification, a method of cold treatment that simulates winter conditions.
- 4. Check for germination after two to three months . Once the pit has grown roots at least half an inch long, remove the pit from the refrigerator.
- 5. Plant the peach seedling in a container . Keep the seedling in a sunny location and provide enough water to keep the soil moist. Move it outdoors in early spring after the last frost.
Growing a peach tree from seed takes three to four years to produce fruit, so a quicker solution is to purchase a young tree from your local nursery to plant in your home garden.
- 1. Choose a type of peach tree that grows in your climate . Peach trees grow best in climates with hot summers and winter temperatures colder than 45°F. Most peach varieties require time in cold temperatures in order to grow effectively. This cold dormancy period is known as a peach tree's “chill hour requirement.” Before choosing a peach variety, look up the number of chilling hours typical of your climate to make sure it meets the requirements for your desired peach variety.
- 2. Plant in late winter or early spring . Plant a container-grown peach tree in early spring so it has the entire growing season to adjust to the environment before winter. Plant bare-root peach trees (dormant trees that are stored without soil on their roots) in late winter.
- 3. Choose a planting site in a full sun location . An extremely sunny and wind-shielded location is ideal. Aim for an area with well-drained sandy soil that has a soil pH between six and seven. If your soil has poor drainage, plant your peach tree in a raised garden bed or a container filled with a sandy, fertile soil or potting mix.
- 4. Dig a planting hole and drive a tree stake into the ground . Make the hole a few inches deeper and twice as wide as the tree's root ball. Hammer the tree stake into the ground next to the hole, at least two feet deep. Create a small soil mound at the bottom of the planting hole.
- 5. Place the tree into the hole . Spread the tree’s roots out over the soil mound. The top of the root crown should be at ground level, while the graft union (the bump in the lower trunk between the scion and rootstock) should rest two to three inches above ground level. Fill the hole halfway with soil and gently mix it around the root system.
- 6. Water the soil and fill in the planting hole . Soak the soil with water and wait until it drains. Next, check whether the depth of the tree’s trunk has changed and adjust if necessary. Fill the rest of the hole with soil.
- 7. Construct a soil basin . Pile a three- to six-inch high ring of soil around the root zone. This soil basin holds in water and allows it to gradually soak into the soil.
- 8. Spread an organic mulch around the root zone . Mulch helps seal in moisture and enrich the soil.
- 9. Prune side branches and trim the top of the tree . Cut the tree down so it's only 30 inches tall. This ensures that your young tree forms lots of fruiting wood, leading to an increase in fruit production once the tree matures. Attach the tree trunk to the stake using tree ties.
Follow these peach tree care tips to give your tree the greatest chance of having a bountiful harvest year after year.
- 1. Give new trees two gallons of water per week . This equals one inch of rainfall. Once peach trees mature, they can go a week and a half with this same amount of water. Keep the soil evenly moist, but make sure it’s never sopping wet.
- 2. Fertilize in early spring with a slow-release fertilizer . Choose a fertilizer high in phosphorus and low in nitrogen for best results.
- 3. Prune trees annually to increase fruit production . Peaches bear fruit on second-year wood, meaning proper pruning this year affects your crop yield next year. Prune trees in the early summer during the tree's first, second, and third years of life. After the third year, prune in late April, and maintain the tree’s shape by cutting shoots growing from the center of the tree.
- 4. Thin out the smaller peaches . About a month after your peach tree blooms, remove the smaller peaches, leaving the larger ones spaced six to eight inches apart. This lets the remaining fruit receive additional nutrients.
- 5. Control pests and prevent diseases . Maladies like peach leaf curl and brown rot are devastating to your crop yield, but you can control both with the proper fungicides. Peachtree borers are a harmful peach tree pest that you can deter with insecticide. Rather than wait for these pests and diseases to strike your peach trees, apply fungicides and pesticides proactively.
To ensure your peaches have a sweet, full flavor, it's imperative you harvest them at the right time. Harvest time varies by peach type, but late June through August is typically when peaches reach peak ripeness. Color is one of the best indicators by which to tell if your peaches are ripe; when their outer skin is completely void of any green coloring, that means they're ready to pick. For the most definitive test, pick one and taste it before harvesting the rest of your crop.

"Debates on climate change can break down fairly fast. There are those who believe that mankind's activities are changing the planet's climate, and those who don't. But a new way to talk about climate change is emerging, which shifts focus from impersonal discussions about greenhouse gas emissions and power plants to a very personal one: your health. It's easy to brush aside debates involving major international corporations, but who wouldn't stop to think -- and perhaps do something -- about their own health, or the health of their children? This new way of talking about climate change -- and linking it to public health issues -- was part of a roundtable discussion Tuesday at Howard University's College of Medicine. President Barack Obama joined U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy and EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy for a roundtable discussion on the topic as part of National Public Health Week. ""I think we've always known -- or at least in the 20th century we've understood -- that environment has an impact on public health,"" the President told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta. ""I remember when I first went to college in Los Angeles in 1979, the air was so bad that you couldn't go running outside,"" Obama said. ""You'd have air quality alerts, and people who had respiratory problems or were vulnerable had to stay inside. We took action, and the air's a lot better."" ""There are a whole host of public health impacts that are going to hit home, so we've got to do better in protecting vulnerable Americans,"" Obama continued. ""Ultimately, though, all of our families are going to be vulnerable. You can't cordon yourself off from air or climate."" Murthy revealed to the group that asthma is a personal issue for him, as a favorite uncle died from a severe attack when he was younger. ""It's also personal to me because I've cared for many patients over the years who have suffered from asthma and have seen firsthand how frightening it can be to suddenly be wheezing and fighting for every breath,"" Murthy said.  ""Asthma can be very difficult for patients, but also for their families. The impacts of climate change could make the situation worse."" ""This is not just a future threat -- this is a present threat,"" said Brian Deese, a senior adviser to the President. Deese cited a recent study by the American Thoracic Society that found seven out of 10 doctors reported climate change is contributing to more health problems among their patients. ""The good news is that, in addition to having doctors and nurses, public health officials, schools of medicine joining together to raise awareness -- and to in some cases impact their practice -- they anticipate, for example, increased asthma instances, and plan ahead of time to deal with those,"" Obama told Gupta. ""What we have is companies like Google and Microsoft that are going to take data we're releasing and start developing apps so that, potentially, individual families are going to be able to monitor the air quality in their communities in a real-time basis."" ""Communities can start planning for prevention and mitigation efforts more effectively, and hopefully the other thing that happens is that families and parents join with these doctors and nurses to start putting some pressure on elected officials to try to make something happen to reduce the impacts of climate change,"" said Obama. The impacts of climate change on health will depend on a multitude of factors, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. ""These factors include the effectiveness of a community's public health and safety systems to address or prepare for the risk and the behavior, age, gender, and economic status of individuals affected,"" the EPA says on its website. ""Impacts will likely vary by region, the sensitivity of populations, the extent and length of exposure to climate change impacts, and society's ability to adapt to change."" The World Health Organization estimates climate change will cause an additional 250,000 deaths per year between 2030 and 2050. ""Most will likely perish from malaria, diarrhea, heat exposure and under-nutrition."" ""Around the world, variations in climate are affecting, in profoundly diverse ways, the air we breathe, the food we eat, and the water we drink,"" writes Dr. Maria Neira, director of the WHO's public health and environment department. ""We are losing our capacity to sustain human life in good health."" ""Consider air pollution, the single greatest environmental health risk we face. In 2012 alone, exposure to indoor and outdoor pollutants killed more than 7 million people -- one in eight deaths worldwide. Under-nutrition already accounts for 3 million deaths each year in the world's poorest regions. Rising temperatures and more variable rainfall patters are expected to reduce crop yields, further compromising food security. Floods are increasing in frequency and intensity, creating breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects. Mosquito-borne diseases, like malaria, are particularly sensitive to heat and humidity. What will happen if rising temperatures accelerate the lifecycle of the malaria parasite?"" ""Children and the elderly will be among the most vulnerable,"" writes Neira. ""Areas with health infrastructure will be least able to cope. Developing countries will be hardest hit. The health gaps we have been trying hard to close may grow even wider."" Earth's average temperature has risen by 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit over the past century, and is projected to rise an additional 2 degrees over the next hundred years, according to the EPA. ""Small changes in the average temperature of the planet can translate to large and potentially dangerous shifts in climate and weather,"" the agency warns. ""Many places have seen changes in rainfall, resulting in more floods, droughts, or intense rain, as well as more frequent and severe heat waves."" Still, there exists a sizable group of people who doubt climate change is happening. ""Although climate scientists have been in the news describing this winter as a strong signal that global warming is producing extreme weather, Americans are no more likely today (55%) than in the past two years to believe the effects of global warming are occurring,"" according to a March Gallup poll. A 2013 TIME magazine article makes the case that medical professionals may be the best messengers for global warming. ""Framing global warming as a public health issue rather than as an environmental or national security one produces the most emotionally compelling response among people, since it focuses on the immediate implications a warmer climate would have on people's lives,"" the article says. ""This strategy also has the benefit of providing a sense of hope that the problems can be addressed and avoided, if action is taken early enough."" The President said what happened with Los Angeles' air proved that point. ""When the Clean Air Act was passed, not only was there a terrible smog in Los Angeles, it was true in most metropolitan areas across the country,"" Obama said. ""The fact is that air quality has dramatically improved and it's been much cheaper than anybody expected, because technology advanced and people figured out how to do it. As a consequence, the American people are a lot healthier, in addition to being able to, you know, see the mountains in the background because it's not covered in smog."" ""We know how to do this,"" Obama said. ""We just have to be bold and recognize and trust the kind of innovative spirit that the American people have always displayed.""
",The President also suggested that companies such as Google and Microsoft are developing apps which could allow families to monitor the air quality in their areas on a real-time basis.,1,0,0.006694480311125517

"The power of a good poem can help make reading a reality for young kids. From making reading fun to teaching kids different ways to think about phonemic sounds, poetry is an invaluable resource in any young reader’s literacy journey.
Here are a few ways poetry helps kids improve their reading skills.
Some parents may have emergent readers who are struggling to find the motivation to pick up a book and hone their skills. If this is the case, try poetry. Kids will find joy in reciting their favorite poems with a caregiver and they’ll gain important literacy skills at the same time. As poetry is typically only a few lines, it may feel less daunting to a young reader to tackle a poem as opposed to a longer book.
While being short, poetry is still packed with important literary elements such as characters, narrative structure, new words, and sometimes rhyming that can help children build foundational and more advanced literacy skills.
The musical rhythm of poems can also remind kids of their favorite songs. The next time you feel like reading a poem with your child, try singing it and see what happens.
Reading poetry helps children about voice, pitch, volume, and inflection . While these are mainly functions of speech, they’re also incredibly important for children learning to read. Poetry can teach young readers about speech patterns, which can give them cues to the words on a page.
Additionally, rhyming can help kids identify sounds in words and identify word families. For example, check out this stanza in the poem “ The Letter A ” by Darren Sardelli:
“Without the A, you couldn’t aim
an arrow in the air.
You wouldn’t ask for apricots
or almonds at a fair.”
This stanza could help young readers practice the short “a” and long “a” sounds and expose them to word families such as “air” and “fair.” For children learning to read, poems that play with sound and rhyme like this one can offer a new perspective on phonetics.
Like any form of reading, poetry can introduce children to new words. Poetry is unique in that it typically follows a rhythm. When children read sentences and phrases that have a cadence, it introduces them to new words in new contexts.
Even though it may not seem like it, a poem that rhymes is the result of certain restrictions a poet followed during the writing process. If they want every other line of a poem to rhyme, there are a limited number of rhyming word pairs that could contextually fit in the first and third lines. For the poet, this results in surprising new connections between words. For the reader, these new connections translate to a larger vocabulary.
In “ The Dentist and the Crocodile, ” Roald Dahl rhymes common words with new words your young reader may not know:
“The crocodile, with cunning smile, sat in the dentist’s chair.
He said, ‘Right here and everywhere my teeth require repair.’”
While “chair” is a pretty common word, “repair” may be less familiar to your child in the same word family. The fact that these words rhyme creates a connection between them, which may make these specific words and other words with an ending “-air” sound easier to remember. At the very least, this poem would help a young reader add “repair” to their vocabulary.
Pablo Picasso once said, “It took me four years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a child.”
Children have wonderful, active imaginations. Poetry can help children tap into their creativity by encouraging them to think about the new and unexpected relationships between words. In addition, having young readers try to write poetry can improve their literacy skills.
The wonderful thing about poetry is that it’s subjective. Poetry can have a narrative structure, nonlinear structure, or even just be a collection of your favorite words. When children are learning to read, giving them the freedom to express themselves through poetry can be both an educational and fun experience. And who knows, the creativity of their writing may surprise you!
One of the seven most important skills for promoting literacy is s upporting oral development . Reading poetry aloud, just like reading other genres aloud, can help children improve their literacy skills. When kids read aloud, they think more deeply about the sound of the words they’re saying and therefore improve their reading skills.
Poetry is the perfect genre for reading aloud because it’s rhythmic, expressive, and fun. Host a poetry reading event in your home or classroom, and share your favorite poems with the little ones.
Love the idea but don’t know where to start? Here are some poetry suggestions to get your kids reading:

Church tradition from the earliest days of Christianity has ascribed these letters to John, commonly believed to be the apostle John—one of Jesus’ chosen twelve, the son of Zebedee, and “the disciple whom Jesus loved” of John’s gospel.
But there’s a problem. Neither the text of the gospel nor that of the letters bears John’s name, or any name. Second and Third John are from the pen of “the elder,” who is not identified. The letters and gospel are anonymous to us, but the Christians who originally received them undoubtedly knew the identity of the author, and it is likely on the ancient testimony of those believers that the letters have been ascribed to John.
But John was a common name at the time, and early in Christian history some came to doubt if “the elder” was the same man as the author of 1 John and John’s gospel. Modern scholarship has complicated the issue even further with most New Testament scholars rejecting the identity of the beloved disciple as the apostle John and conjecturing as many as five different author or redactors for the gospel and letters.

The earliest ascription of authorship to John comes from Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna (d. AD 156), and from Papias, a contemporary of Polycarp, whose writings survive only as quotations in the later writings of Irenaeus and Eusebius.
Both Polycarp and Papias lived in the greater vicinity of Ephesus in western Asia Minor, the location to which the apostle John is said to have fled at about the time when the Romans destroyed the temple in Jerusalem (AD 70), taking Mary the mother of Jesus with him. There he presumably lived for the rest of his long life, on into the reign of Trajan, the Roman emperor who ruled the empire from AD 98 to 117.
Irenaeus (AD 175–195), bishop of Lyon, was born in Asia Minor and as a child personally knew Polycarp, who is said to have been appointed bishop of Smyrna by eyewitnesses of the Lord Jesus. Irenaeus says that John, the disciple of the Lord who was with Jesus in the upper room, wrote the gospel of John while living in Ephesus (Haer. 3.1.2).
Even though such sources are subject to the same historical scrutiny as other ancient documents, this is a remarkable chain of historical witnesses—from Irenaeus, to Polycarp, to John himself—enjoyed by no other New Testament book.
The witness of Papias is more complicated and has been the subject of more debate, for his writings are preserved only in those of Eusebius, whose interpretation of Papias’s words raised the possibility of two men named John, one authoring the gospel and another, the elder John, the letters and the book of Revelation.
Papias mentions John twice, once as a “disciple of the Lord” and again as an “elder.” But Eusebius overlooked the fact that even when Papias refers to Peter and James, he doesn’t at first call them “apostles” but “elders,” suggesting that the two titles were not mutually exclusive in Papias.
But ever since the fourth century when Eusebius wrote, there has been debate in the church about the authorship of the three letters attributed in the New Testament to John.
Although the issue of authorship will not likely ever be known with certainty, the author of these letters clearly claims to be a bearer of the apostolic teaching about Jesus that was based on eyewitness testimony about his public ministry, death , and resurrection.
The relationship between the three letters and between them and the gospel indicates that the same author likely wrote all three letters, and he was also either the author of the gospel or a close associate. These letters insist that this apostolic testimony trumps any reinterpretation of Jesus by those who were not commissioned by him and who were far removed from personal knowledge of him.
All books of the New Testament refer to events that happened in the first century, such as the life of Jesus, the spread of the gospel, and issues that arose in the infant churches. The New Testament books were themselves written in the second half of that century. The New Testament as a whole is focused on one person who lived in the early third of the first century, Jesus of Nazareth, and the significance of his life, death, and resurrection.
The Gospels telling that story were written some decades later and so are concerned, first, with the events of Jesus’ lifetime recorded but, second, with what was happening in the churches to which each gospel was addressed and which shaped their content. Thus, it is appropriate to consider what was happening in the churches that were the original recipients of John’s gospel, most likely the last gospel to be written.
The New Testament letters are different from these narrative accounts of the life of Jesus because each letter addressed pressing issues of the moment rather than recounting events from a previous time period. The authors of the letters are addressing real questions, issues, and circumstances that are pressing at that moment of time.
Consequently, they allow us to distinguish three periods of the first century and place the events and the origin of the books within each period:
- Jesus’ lifetime, during which no New Testament books were written;
- a period of great expansion of the gospel throughout the Roman empire (AD 33 – 60); and
- a period of doctrinal and ecclesial unification (c. AD 60 – 100).
The gospel and letters of John were written within this last period, when the church at large faced huge issues, such as organized persecution of Christians by the Roman government, heresy infiltrating the church (especially from the various Greek philosophies), and a crisis of church leadership, especially as the apostles died and the Lord had not returned.
John’s letters reflect the second and third issues: heresy and a crisis of leadership. False teachers had emerged from the elder’s own church(es), and their beliefs were challenging his apostolic leadership. If the elder was John son of Zebedee, he was likely elderly and the last living apostle. As the church stood on the brink of an uncertain future in the midst of a transition to church leaders who were not apostles, there was no more critical issue than where the truth about Jesus Christ was to be found. The elder argues that Christian leadership is essentially conservative, preserving and passing to the next generation the teaching of the apostles whom the Lord himself had chosen. Innovation in Christian belief and practice had to be bounded by apostolic orthodoxy. This is relevant in every generation of the church until the Lord returns.

"Dolphins Trade Target: Chase Young
The Miami Dolphins are coming off a controversial loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday night which saw two early-season Super Bowl contenders go head-to-head on national television.
The Eagles defense (and the refs) stood tall in taking down the Dolphins, who saw a much improved play from their defense, but as the trade deadline approaches all NFL journalists, sports talk podcasts, and shows airing on national TV and every sports streaming platform are focused on which players will be switching teams.
The Dolphins will have an influx of talent coming back to action in the coming weeks, such as Xavien Howard, Jalen Ramsey, Connor Williams, Terron Armstead, and De'Von Achane.
However, there are still some needs along the offensive line, and in areas of the defense, some of which can be addressed at the trade deadline.
Chase Young
Probably not the first name that comes to mind when thinking of needs for the Dolphins, but the struggles of the defensive line in getting consistent pressure with their front four has been a talking point all season.
CBS Sports’ Josina Anderson reports that “several identifiable teams” are prepared to pull off a trade for Young or Montez Sweat from the Commanders, and while it may seem unlikely that Young will land in Miami, it's certainly something that should be, at the very least, explored.
First, Emmanuel Ogbah has been ineffective this season, collecting just 2.5 sacks on the season, a far cry from the 9 sacks he had in both the 2020 and 2021 seasons (prior to injury).
To be fair, the likes of Christian Wilkins have not played to their expected level, and the line as a whole has struggled.
Trading for Young, who is five years younger and has 5 sacks this season, would be a massive upgrade for the Dolphins.
It must be mentioned that trading for Young would lead to an immediate need to sign him to a long-term extension. Miami is certainly going to have some serious questions and decisions to make regarding their cap situation in the future, but if they were willing to sign Indianapolis Colts running back Jonathan Taylor to a lucrative contract, they certainly could do so with Young, and perhaps it may be a bit cheaper.
Bringing Young to a rush that includes Wilkins, Zach Sieler, Jaelen Phillips, and Bradley Chubb would certainly boost the line's potency as they prepare for a playoff push.
Miami has struggled generating sacks this season, so adding Young would go a long way into boosting that number, and helping other areas of the defense as well.",The Miami Dolphins are reportedly considering a trade for Chase Young or Montez Sweat from the Commanders.,1,1,0.9306727647781372
"[1] The act of squinting, quite obviously, alters the shape of the space through which light passes, which helps us form a more crisp image on the retina. You see, as one ages, the lenses gradually become harder and loses the ability to focus as well as they used to. This is why most senior citizens use corrective glasses, which help to better focus the incoming light rays on the retina.
There is a tiny portion of the retina, called the fovea, that is packed with cones and gives us the ability to see things as crisp and clear as they really are.

[2] By squinting, you inadvertently help the eye lens, as the eyelids block out most of the light from other directions. This leaves the lens to deal with fewer light rays that also pass closer together through its center. Therefore, the whole process of focusing light rays becomes more precise and you can see a clearer image.

[3] Your eye is like a camera, and blurriness comes mostly from the way it captures and processes light. Photons pass through your lens, which focuses them onto a spot at the back of your retina. There, specialized photoreceptive structures called rods and cones convert these photons into electromagnetic impulses that your brain interprets as shapes, colors, and textures.
Your lens changes shape in order to focus on things both near and far. However, there are limits to its flexibility. When something is blurry, it usually means the light being focused by your lens is either under- or overshooting the focal point at the back of your retina (though blurriness can also be caused by physical damage to your eyeball).
The light from the thing you are trying to look at is also competing with light from everything else in your field of view.

I thought the Mac and cheese was a little dry/bland but with a little salt and pepper on it, it helped. I thought the potato salad with bacon was pretty good but needed something acidic to break down all the starchiness.

To be fair i warned them when they were kids: your uncle is going to expect to be paid back for all the driving, picking up, leaving off, etc., etc., i did for you. So NOW is that time.\nBut for now i am relishing the well earned attention. And i'm only 1/2 kidding here in any event.\nSeveral weeks ago my niece told me about Neighbor Tim's both as a food truck and a stand alone BBQ joint.\nI zipped into SB and asked her to bring some BBQ for me, her kids and hubby as well as for my sisters. She raved about this place. So i thought: ok, sounds good: so bring me some, please.\nWell bring me some she did:\nPork ribs\nBrisket\nPotato Salad\nMac and cheese\nWhite Bread thick sliced\nSauce: Amazing Sauce it is called\nBurnt Ends (from another time but reviewed here)\nThe ribs were perfectly cooked and meaty. I am a purist when it comes to ribs. they must be tender and juicy but not falling off the bone meaning i pick one up and the meat falls off. That is too well cooked, usually cooked with too much moisture and not enough heat or smoke.\nThese ribs though were well smoked, well seasoned (not too salty) and were delivered w/o sauce which is the way i prefer them so that you can taste the meat and not just the sauce. The sauce btw is super also: vinegary, light on the sugars with a snappy chili finish: north carolina style which surprised me only because i thought this was a Texas style BBQ joint. But it works so why fight it. \nThe Brisket was also well seasoned and smoked as well as very moist and tender. No knife needed to cut and we made sammys using the white bread and dipping in the sauce to finish.\nThe Mac and cheese is nothing special: just cheese sauce and noodles. This needed salt and pepper for starters. \nThe potato salad was a big letdown also: the dressing was good and in the right proportion: neither too much or not enough but again salt and pepper would have helped and acid is needed desperately. Pickles, mustard, maybe or both?  Also most damning is that the potatoes were slightly undercooked. in other words too al dente for my taste. \nThick white bread was in the Texas toast style and it was real tasty: reminded me of a traditional pullman loaf. Yeasty, high quality bread not Wonder Bread, remember?\nThe burnt ends were not part of this order but we had these about 4 weeks ago and they were absolutely first rate: charred, and well seasoned to within an inch of their lives. Tim's are made from the deckle of the brisket i am going to assume and are super tasty chunks of beefy goodness. Next day you can thinly slice and use in a taco or sammy or just to pop in your mouth while pretending to grab a beer from the refer.\nAll in all a very good sampling today of Neighbor Tim's wares:  what they do well they do very, very well.

"STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Next, we're going to talk about an uneasy alliance in the fight over gun control. The gun industry makes weapons. The National Rifle Association is a leading voice for gun rights. They share common interests, of course, but it's emerging that they may not always have the same opinions about fighting the change in gun laws.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Paul Barrett of Bloomberg Businessweek has been talking with gun makers.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: What is it you think has been overlooked about the - whatever you want to call it - the gun lobby, the gun industry, gun rights advocates, what did you discover?
PAUL BARRETT: It's becoming almost conventional wisdom that the reason the NRA goes to such extremes is that it is driven by the gun industry. And in fact, that understanding is just incorrect. If anything, it is the NRA that sets the terms of the debate and the gun industry basically obediently follows along.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: What are some things that the National Rifle Association has said in recent months that have caused people in the gun industry who talked to you to cringe?
PAUL BARRETT: Well, the most specific thing has been the series of performances by Wayne LaPierre, the CEO and longtime head of the NRA, who has taken the group to what I would describe as a new extreme in terms of its pugnacious stance in the wake of the Newtown Elementary School massacre. And I think many people in the gun industry, given a choice, would not take the conspiratorial sort of paranoid approach that LaPierre specializes in. That said, they are doing nothing to try to deter him - for two reasons. One, they're afraid of the consumer boycotts that the NRA can organize if it chooses. And two, the NRA's hype actually does benefit the gun industry.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Is that a real possibility, that the NRA could organize a boycott of Smith & Wesson or some other brand of firearm?
PAUL BARRETT: It's not just a real possibility; it's something that has happened in the past. In 2000, which really was the last time before the current round of debate that we had a live gun control debate at the national level. Smith and Wesson actually tried to step up and arrive at a truce with the Clinton administration and with government officials around the country who were suing the gun industry. And Smith & Wesson agreed to settle those lawsuits and to comply with an unprecedented level of regulation. The result of that was that the NRA, other gun rights groups, encouraged gun buyers to boycott Smith & Wesson. In the space of six to eight months, the company almost went out of business. Plants were shut down, production lines were closed, and ultimately, the company changed ownership, reneged on the settlement and was accepted back into the fold. This is not a theoretical possibility. This is what happens when you cross the NRA.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Are there specific reforms - if we want to call them that - that gun manufacturers would sign on to if the NRA was not in the way of them doing so?
PAUL BARRETT: It's more question of whether they would object. One of the main proposals pending before Congress, and in fact, the White House has identified this as its top priority, is to make the background check system comprehensive, so that it would be legally required for all gun transactions to go through some type of computerized background check.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Mm-hmm.
PAUL BARRETT: In fact, the gun industry is basically agnostic on that point. It's not that they're going to stand up and cheer in favor of it, but almost their entire stock and trade is already done through the licensed background check system. So the gun industry would just basically stand by and say very little if it were purely up to them. But they're not going to stand up and get into a fight with Wayne LaPierre in public.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Paul Barrett of Bloomberg Businessweek, thanks very much.
PAUL BARRETT: My pleasure. Thanks for having me.

Member-only story Outlier Detection: A Comprehensive overview of different methods

Mathematical and statistical background of Various outlier detection methods with a detailed comparison between the use cases Imdadul Haque Milon · Follow Published in Gadictos · 7 min read · May 8, 2021 -- 1 Share

Most real-world data sets have outliers that have unusually small or big values than the typical values of the data set. Outliers can have a negative impact on data analysis if not detected correctly and also outliers can reveal significant information and characteristics of data. There are several methods to detect an outlier in the data set. It is important to understand the characteristics of these methods properly since they might be quite powerful with large normal data but it is problematic to apply them to nonnormal data or small sample sizes without proper knowledge of their characteristics. In this article, we will discuss different outlier detection methods and how to apply them properly in the data set.

Outlier

An outlier is an observation that lies at an unusual distance from other observations in a random sample of a population. There’s actually no specific way to define the unusual distance and it depends on the datasets, use cases, and applications. Generally, the person who works with data defines what should be the unusual distance. Outliers can be caused by many reasons e.g. data entry mistakes, taking data from different populations, wrong measurements, etc. To see the impact of an outlier we can take a simple data set 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and explore the various statistics of this data set.

Now, if we change the last observation from 9 to 99,

As we can see, the mean and variance have become much bigger due to one value got bigger while the median remains the same. Also, the 95%…",Deviation method**: This method uses the mean and standard deviation of the data to define a threshold for outliers. - **,1,0,0.031031684949994087
"Ravi Opi, Kavre District, Nepal (CNN)By the time you reach the outskirts of Nepal's capital, even the roads are showing signs of the sheer magnitude of this earthquake -- and the enormity of the task awaiting a country struggling to come to terms with devastation and tragedy. The main highway that heads east out of Kathmandu shows massive cracks, the tarmac torn apart by the force of Saturday's huge tremor. One lane is bisected by gaping, half-meter (1.5 feet) fissures. They've been filled in with rubble and dirt, allowing passage for those desperate citizens to reach their families in outlying districts. It takes an age, though, picking our way along damaged roads to a small village community, Ravi Opi. It is only 30 kilometers (20 miles) east of Kathmandu but the journey takes almost two hours -- and the travel times likely to be compounded the farther out from the city people go. The community is off the main highway, down a dirt track that quickly finds itself winding through forested slopes and terraced fields. They farm corn here, and millet, and vegetables. Compared to the capital, and the regions west of Kathmandu and closer to the epicenter, the people here were relatively lucky. Still, passing through villages it's clear that damage has been suffered. In Ravi Opi a village official walks quickly by, telling us over his shoulder that 90% of the houses are currently uninhabitable. Some are still standing, but seem precarious and the residents are too scared of aftershocks to move back inside. Patchy reports have filtered through of entire villages leveled by the quake or engulfed by landslides. Maili Tamang, 62, is alive, but surveys the desolation the quake has wreaked on her life. We find her sitting as close as she can to the ruins of the house that she built with her late husband. She's petite and frail but hardened by life. Her leg, bandaged and suppurating, is stretched out in front of her. She periodically flicks at the flies that have settled on the blood- and pus-soaked dressing. ""I just want to cry, all I feel is hurt "" she says, showing us where she was the moment the earthquake struck. Tamang's house was one of the bigger ones in this region, a rare two-story structure. She and her husband built it together, a lifetime ago. He died years ago, but her extended family lived here with her until Saturday. She, along with her daughter-in-law were indoors when the quake struck, and she was lucky to make it out onto a small wooden balcony. Another tremor brought this down and she had to extricate herself from the rubble and crawl up an embankment. The younger woman, trapped in the wreckage after the roof fell in on her, eventually clawed her way out. She was transported by motorbike -- few here have motorized transportation; most walk -- to a missionary hospital in a neighboring village, 12 kilometers (7.4 miles) away from here. Now she is back, wondering what the next step for her is. Throughout this region, there have been small landslides and people have been industrious in clearing rubble from the roads. There is little sign of aid having made it out here. Out of necessity people are back working their fields. Near the road a family makes lunch in the open as their house was destroyed. Elsewhere in Ravi Opi, other unfortunate families count the cost of the disaster. Mahesh Koiraba, 31, lost his only daughter, Prati in the quake, who was killed as their house collapsed. She was 2 years old. He was working when the quake hit, tilling the fields like so many in Kavre, and ran back to his house after quickly realizing the force of the tremor. ""I started digging with my hands,"" he says, still very much in shock, but remembering his frantic efforts among the remains of his damaged home. ""And I saw her, blood was trickling from her mouth and she was covered in cuts."" All he has left now is a picture in his phone; a chubby-faced toddler, wearing oversized sunglasses. As rain starts falling -- soon turning into torrents and further hampering recovery efforts -- we huddle with four families who have been displaced. They're in a makeshift, ramshackle shelter, crowded with frightened people. I ask one of the young women, Osminda Koirale, with me if she has seen any sign of outside help. ""No, no government has any support for us. No one has come out to see that we're living like this."" She said it was terrifying, and the future no less so. ""Our house is gone now. We don't know where we sit, what we eat. We don't have any clothes, all our clothes are inside. We can't go inside our houses."" There was a creeping sense that the worst was over, until another powerful aftershock overnight. ""We are not safe ... we are so scared,"" Osminda tells me. And all this a mere 90 minutes drive from the capital. There are parts of Nepal so remote it takes days to reach under normal circumstances -- there are villages here that one can only reach on foot and it is those areas that were hardest hit. These are the places where aid has yet to arrive, and where no one really knows the full extent of human loss or how many tragedies like the one at this home have unfolded. Arwa Damon reported from Kavre District in Nepal and Euan McKirdy wrote from Hong Kong.

April 6, 2021
In the two years since the self-declared Islamic State lost its last physical stronghold in Raqqa, Syria, thousands of ISIS foreign fighters, along with their wives and children, have remained in limbo, mostly in Iraqi custody or in Kurdish detention camps in northeastern Syria.
The question now is what to do with them — an issue that gained urgency following a United Nations Security Council briefing last month on a resurgence of ISIS in Syria.
Roughly 40,000 traveled to the self-declared Islamic State from 81 countries. Some fought in Iraq and Syria for ISIS, while others, including some women and their children, were victims of violence. Whether they came willingly or not, those who remain — some 64,000 from 57 countries, mostly women and children — live amid dire conditions that human rights groups have described as breeding grounds for future radicalization.
What should happen next to the fighters is relatively clear, according to international law experts. “All terrorist crimes need to be prosecuted,” said Naureen Fink, executive director of The Soufan Center, a global security research institute, echoing a sentiment expressed by all 17 extremism and counterterrorism experts with whom FRONTLINE spoke for this story.
Who should be responsible for holding those trials is not so straightforward. There is no international tribunal with a mandate to prosecute ISIS-related crimes, and the International Criminal Court does not have jurisdiction in Iraq or Syria. Iraq has tried more than 20,000 cases of ISIS-related crimes. But with a judicial system internationally criticized for due process and human rights violations, Iraq poses a dilemma for countries with conflicting human rights standards. And while they’re considered an ally by the U.S. in fighting ISIS, the Kurdish forces running the camps in northeastern Syria are not recognized as a government with the authority to hold trials.
“Repatriating terrorists would be political suicide.”
Meanwhile, a FRONTLINE review of the 10 states that yielded the largest numbers of ISIS foreign fighters and family members found that most of these countries, especially in Europe and the Middle East, are reluctant to repatriate their citizens. Children and women — the latter of whom are often seen as victims — have been the primary exceptions, especially in Central Asian countries.
For some European leaders, “repatriating terrorists would be political suicide,” said Thomas Renard, a senior research fellow at the Egmont Royal Institute for International Relations in Belgium. European nations also claim that home-country courts might not be able to successfully prosecute fighters due to a lack of battlefield evidence, Renard said.
That’s an issue the UN attempted to address in 2018 by establishing an investigative team, UNITAD, with a mandate to collect criminal evidence and to identify and bring witnesses back to testify in home-country courts. To date, UNITAD, has provided evidence for 30 trials in 10 countries.
In the U.S., the official policy under former President Donald Trump was pro-repatriation. The State Department said 28 American ISIS fighters and their family members have been returned to the U.S. to date — from a total of about 300, based on statistics provided by George Washington University’s Program on Extremism. President Joe Biden’s administration will do the same, a State Department spokesperson told FRONTLINE.
Of the 28 people repatriated, 12 adults have faced charges related to terrorism, according to the State Department. “We encourage countries to take back their foreign terrorist fighters and associated dependents from Syria and Iraq,” the State Department wrote in an e-mail to FRONTLINE. “The United States believes that repatriation, prosecution as appropriate, and rehabilitation and reintegration is the best way to keep fighters off the battlefield and address the humanitarian crisis in detention centers and [internally displaced people] camps in [northeast] Syria.”
Those 12 Americans include Sam Sally, the subject of the December 2020 documentary Return From ISIS and the companion podcast I’m Not A Monster from FRONTLINE and the BBC.
“Lack of transparency translates to lack of accountability.”
Many countries either don’t know or don’t disclose the number of citizens who traveled to join ISIS — including all countries in the top 10, save for Russia — and many don’t make public the number of returnees brought to trial. “Lack of transparency translates to lack of accountability,” said Fink of The Soufan Center. “It helps countries not to be transparent, because they don’t want to talk about what they’re doing when [fighters] come back.”
Fighters who do come home, either by government intervention or on their own, are considered a “great security threat for countries upon their return,” said Gina Vale, co-author of a 2019 International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR) report that offers the most recent estimates of individuals affiliated with ISIS by country.
FRONTLINE spoke with 20 experts — legal and regional specialists, as well as foreign ministries to understand if, and how, the 10 countries that produced the most foreign fighters are pursuing repatriation and prosecution of ISIS-related crimes.
Unlike the U.S. and some of Europe, Turkey — long a back door to ISIS territory, given its shared border with Syria — did not criminalize travel to Syria or Iraq, except in cases where it could prove intent to join ISIS.
For Turkish citizens who return from ISIS and are convicted of membership in a terrorist organization, the typical sentence is five to 10 years, said Berkay Mandıracı, a Turkish policy analyst at the International Crisis Group. In practice, however, time served is often three to four years under the “active remorse clause,” which allows returned Turks to trade information — including testifying against others — for shorter sentences.
Mandıracı also cited other ready sources of evidence, including ISIS identification documents seized at the border and intelligence from Turkish security units stationed in northern Syria. Turkey’s information pipeline gives it an advantage in seeing ISIS-related cases go to trial , Mandıracı said, although the Turkish ministry hasn’t released the number of prosecutions or repatriations to date.
“ Prosecution processes of [ISIS]-affiliated women … imprisoned in Iraq have been going on for a while,” the Turkish embassy in Washington, D.C., wrote in a statement. “We have conveyed our request to relevant Iraqi authorities to transfer those convicted to Turkey to serve the rest of their sentences.”
Officials did identify the number of individuals affiliated with ISIS it has deported: at least 8,000 from 43 countries. That includes at least 77 European detainees who escaped into Turkey following an October 2019 Turkish military incursion into Syria. According to the Egmont Royal Institute, 73 of those Europeans were women and children.
Tunisia represents the world’s most ISIS fighters per capita. Its shared border with Libya, where ISIS held territory, acted as a key entry point for fighters both foreign and domestic.
Tunisia has not taken a public stance on repatriation. “More than 800 of [its] fighters have already returned — and quite a few of them undetected,” said Dr. Hans-Jakob Schindler, a senior director at the Geneva-based Counter Extremism Project. In February 2019, Human Rights Watch called Tunisia’s efforts to repatriate its citizens “ scant ” and reported that the number of returned fighters may be closer to 1,500. As of July 2019, ICSR had identified at least 970 returnees.
Common charges for returnees who are prosecuted — a number that’s not public — include membership in a terrorist organization and endangerment of national security, both of which fall under a terrorism law that has been widely criticized for overreach. “When you read it, you can apply it to protestors,” Schindler said.
In January 2020, Tunisia repatriated six orphaned children of ISIS-affiliated parents from Libya, the most recent publicly acknowledged repatriations. The Tunisian government did not respond to FRONTLINE’s request for comment.
“I’ve long suspected countries of both under-reporting and over-reporting.”
Facing new threats from ISIS-affiliated groups around Afghanistan’s northern borders, Russia has adopted a policy of transparency, publishing personal information about its foreign fighters. The country’s Federal Financing Monitoring Service, meant to counter terrorism and weapons financing, lists the names of over 10,600 citizens who have participated in foreign extremism —including ISIS, among insurgencies in Pakistan, Afghanistan and elsewhere. It’s a move designed to discourage radicalizing youth, according to three Russian counterterrorism experts who spoke with FRONTLINE.
“[Russian President Vladimir] Putin is actually maintaining transparency because this is a message to others that they will be found and tried and imprisoned and punished,” Vladimir Sotnikov, a policy analyst on international terrorism at St. Petersburg’s state-run Russian Academy of Sciences, told FRONTLINE.
But according to Colin Clarke of The Soufan Group, an intelligence and global security consultancy, countries like Russia and China might overestimate their numbers of extremist fighters in order to enact stricter laws and justify civil rights abuses. “I’ve long suspected countries of both under-reporting and over-reporting,” Clarke said. “They say, ‘Look, this is this massive threat in our country,’ almost as a justification to some of the really draconian and horrific things we’ve seen take place.”
Russia has openly called for the return of Russian children, and Russian media outlets have reported that at least 150 children had been repatriated as of February 2020. The numbers of adults who have been repatriated and have stood trial is not available.
Russia’s longest counterterrorism sentence is 15 years; a mild sentence is five to seven years, Sotnikov said. Neither the Russian foreign ministry nor the Russian embassy in the U.S, responded to FRONTLINE’s request for comment.
Saudi Arabia’s track record on ISIS-related repatriation is murky, said Adam Coogle, deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa at Human Rights Watch.
ICSR identified approximately 762 Saudi returnees as of July 2019. But according to Coogle, both Saudi Arabia and Jordan “regularly censor publication of information that could be embarrassing, and this would certainly fit the bill.”
Under a 2014 royal decree , any Saudi citizen who fights in foreign conflicts could face three to 20 years in jail. Human Rights Watch has found that former Saudis affiliated with ISIS can avoid charges by entering rehabilitation, as part of the country’s Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Aftercare strategy. An unknown number of others have been prosecuted in trials Coogle calls “laughably unfair.”
“Defendants do not get a lawyer or even learn their charges until they are brought to their first trial session,” Coogle said.
The Saudi government did not respond to FRONTLINE’s request for comment.
Jordan’s official policy is to prevent “terrorists or their families” who traveled to Iraq or Syria from returning home, although ICSR estimates that about 300 Jordanians affiliated with ISIS have done so.
According to Coogle, that number could have been higher. Allegations have arisen that Jordan has prevented citizens from returning via unofficial border crossings with Syria — a common route before 2018.
Those who voluntarily make their way to foreign consulates or embassies are usually sent for interrogation and then on to Jordan’s State Security Court, which often prosecutes on “vague charges,” Coogle said. The number of trials to date is not available. “Convictions are obtained nearly always based solely on the person’s confession, which is often tainted by torture/ill-treatment,” Coogle said — criticism backed by the Geneva-based human rights group Al Karama.
The Jordanian government did not respond to FRONTLINE’s request for comment.
As in Saudi Arabia, sentences range from three to 20 years.
“[Central Asian countries] are pretty united with rejection of bringing men home,” said Anne Speckhard, director of the International Center for the Study of Violent Extremism. “They judge the men harshly.”
Like other countries, Uzbekistan has had difficulty tracking men who return on their own accord. Uzbekistan has relaxed border regulations with Russia to allow for labor migration, making it hard to distinguish between types of travel.
Unlike men, women are seen “as having little choice,” Speckhard said. More than 318 Uzbek citizens — all women and children — have been repatriated from Syria and Iraq over the course of three missions, according to Javlon Vakhabov, Uzbekistan’s ambassador to the U.S.
The women who are prosecuted — an unknown number — face charges of religious extremism and international terrorism. “If they are found guilty, of course we will bring them into justice by law,” Vakhabov said. “But at the same time, we prioritize to rehabilitate and reintegrate them into normal life, rather than punishing them, depending on the severity of their crimes.”
In 2015, Tajikistan announced amnesty for ISIS fighters who returned home voluntarily, expressed remorse and renounced ties to foreign militant groups. By 2019, at least 100 citizens had accepted the offer — with mixed success.
As of 2018, there were at least 30 known cases of recidivism, with Tajiks re-joining the Islamic State. “It comes down to the question of stigma,” said Gavin Helf, Central Asia expert at the United States Institute of Peace. “One of the government officials in Tajikistan [we spoke to] said they never expected the people to come back. The state media demonizes these people as defects duped into going [to ISIS territory] and irredeemable.”
Experts told FRONTLINE that Tajikistan has actively repatriated mostly women and children, largely as a way to gain more political leverage with the United States and other Western countries. Having international support is “ a convenient way to get assistance or justify behavior towards their own population,” Helf told FRONTLINE.
With the February 2019 announcement of its plan to repatriate children, Tajikistan policy preceded that of many Western and Arab states. By December 2020, Tajikistan had arranged for the return of 200 citizens — mostly women and children — from Syria. The total number of repatriations to date is not available.
Although Tajik officials did not respond to FRONTLINE’s inquiry, the Tajik ministry of foreign affairs released a statement in February 2021 , saying “works are underway” to bring women and children back from “war-torn countries in the Middle East.”
Although France has strict terrorism laws allowing defendants to stand trial in absentia, that practice is uncommon. The government also tends not to repatriate, according to Egmont’s Thomas Renard.
The return of 10 orphans of French nationals from Syria on June 22, 2020, brought the country’s total ISIS-related repatriations to approximately 35 — all children.
“France is on the tougher end of the spectrum, and there is the possibility to pass quite long sentences” for crimes related to terrorism, said Anthony Dworkin, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. But terrorism events in France since 2015 — including the ISIS-claimed attack on the Bataclan concert hall in Paris that killed more than 100 people — have made repatriation less politically acceptable.
Nevertheless, the government came under public fire after 11 French nationals were sentenced to death in Iraq on June 3, 2019, as France does not practice capital punishment. President Emmanuel Macron had insisted that Iraq could try the cases, despite international concern over Iraqi courts’ human rights record.
In February, 10 French women detained in northeastern Syria staged a hunger strike as a means of pressuring France to repatriate them, according to The New York Times .
“It’s always in the short-term easier to leave them there,” said Dworkin. “The difficulty is seeing what’s going to change that dynamic now.”
The French government did not respond to FRONTLINE’s request for comment.
“From a security perspective, doing nothing is the worst of all options.”
Germany has conducted very few repatriations, according to Hannah Neumann, one of the country’s elected members of European Parliament who sits on the human rights and security committees. The Egmont Royal Institute put the total around seven as of October 2020. In December 2020, Germany repatriated three women and 12 children from Syria, bringing the total to 22. This doesn’t include an unknown number of Germans deported by Turkey. Prior to December, ICSR estimated 357 total German returnees.
According to the German Federal Foreign Office, any ISIS returnees who are brought to trial — an unknown number, to date — typically face charges of membership in a terrorist group, which carries a 10-year sentence. Other charges include occupying a living space from which ISIS victims have fled, which constitutes the appropriation of property — a war crime, according to the Foreign Office.
Reaching prosecution on either charge is difficult, especially in cases where German nationals hold dual citizenship. There’s also a reluctance to repatriate citizens from areas under Kurdish control, given Germany’s strong relationship with Turkey, which does not recognize Kurdish jurisdiction in Syria.
In light of potential security risks, Neumann has argued for Germany to play a more active role. “At one point or another, these people will eventually escape, or they will be released. Even a Kurdish administration cannot keep them there for 10 to 20 years,” she said. “They have not undergone any deradicalization programs. They are free-floating. We don’t know how they are or where they are. From a security perspective, doing nothing is the worst of all options.”
There has been one sign of movement. In April 2020, what is believed to be the world’s first trial related to charges of genocide committed against the Yazidi — an Iraqi minority group, of whom ISIS captured and enslaved approximately 7,000 women and girls — began in Germany, as one of the defendants is German. The trial is ongoing.
Kazakhstan’s approach is “almost entirely humanitarian in nature,” Yerzhan Ashykbayev, the country’s deputy minister of foreign affairs, told the Atlantic Council , an international affairs think tank, in January 2021.
Like most of Central Asia, Kazakhstan almost exclusively repatriates women and children and has received global commendation for its efforts to bring home and reintegrate Kazakh citizens — at least 700 in total, according to the Kazakh embassy in the U.S. In 2019 alone, Kazakhstan brought back an estimated 524 individuals from former ISIS territory. Of those, 33 were men, all of whom were prosecuted as ISIS fighters.
Rehabilitation efforts have included giving the children of ISIS fighters Kazakh birth certificates and Kazakh names. But Helf, of the United States Institute of Peace, told FRONTLINE that children are struggling to readjust, and some women have refused to work with authorities. Meanwhile, other women have rejected the invitation to return.
“Kazakhstan tried, but some people don’t want to come back,” Helf said. “But the door is open.”
The Kazakh government did not respond to FRONTLINE’s request for comment.
April 16, 2021, update: T he press department of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote to FRONTLINE post-publication on April 15 and said that, as of March 2021, 274 children had been evacuated from detention camps but did not mention men or women. In a post-publication response to FRONTLINE on April 13, the Kazakhstani embassy in Washington, D.C., said participation in ISIS is forbidden in Kazakhstan, and terrorist activities, including recruiting members and distributing terrorist propaganda, are considered crimes against public security and order. Prison sentences range from 8 to 14 years for men.

"[1] What we perceive as temperature is an average effect. In any given quantity of water, individual molecules are moving at different speeds. Low energy/low temperature molecules move slowly; high energy/high temperature ones move fast. While the average temperature of the liquid may be below boiling, some molecules build up enough speed as a result of random collisions to break free from the liquid’s surface and enter the surrounding air. This is the process we know as evaporation.

[2] What’s the difference between evaporation and boiling? During evaporation, some hotter-than-average molecules escape the liquid, taking their heat energy with them. (As a result, what’s left behind on average is cooler, which is why evaporation of sweat helps to cool us). During boiling, on the other hand, so much heat has been added to the water that all the molecules are scrambling to escape, and the water turns to steam.

[3] Evaporation isn’t the only thing happening at the molecular level. Some molecules of water vapor in the air slow down enough that when they strike your skin they stick. This process is called condensation. Evaporation and condensation occur simultaneously, but since the particles are so small we only see the net effect.

[4] Water is a liquid because the dipole attraction between polar water molecules makes them stick together. At standard atmospheric pressure (acting somewhat like a vice), you need a comparatively large temperature of 100°C (translating to a high average energy distributed among the micsroscopic degrees of freedom, most relevantly the kinetic ones) for water molecules to break free in bulk, creating bubbles of water vapour within the liquid.
However, at the surface of the liquid, lone molecules may end up getting enough kinetic energy to break free due to the random nature of molecular motion at basically any temperature. On the flip side, water molecules in the atmosphere may enter the liquid at the surface as well, which is measured by equilibrium vapour pressure.","During evaporation, some hotter-than-average molecules escape the liquid, taking their heat energy with them.",1,1,0.9737544059753418

"It's no surprise which image is making the headlines from this week's gathering of leaders from nearly three dozen nations in Panama: A historic handshake between President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro. But this first meeting of Obama and Castro since they announced plans to start normalizing diplomatic ties should not be the end of the summit story. Or at least Obama is hoping it won't be. After all, the President has had some unhappy experiences at hemispheric summits, where the headlines have often focused on some less than flattering moments. The reality is that the United States has been losing ground in this increasingly important region, and Obama needs to put on a strong performance in Panama at the Summit of the Americas if the U.S. is to have a chance of improving ties with neighbors who should be best friends, but who have drifted away as America has been focused on challenges at home and instability in the Middle East. Unfortunately, America has lost influence in Latin America to a hyperactive China, a cunning Russia and a troubling Iran, all of which have made inroads in the region at Washington's expense. This gathering therefore offers a chance for the U.S. to reverse the tide and build on the potential offered by a natural alliance strengthened by millions of people with Latin American and Caribbean blood who make their homes in the United States. The foundations for a strong hemispheric bloc are there. But they need attention, and the Panama meeting offers a good opportunity to start building. But first: Do no harm. Large diplomatic gatherings are minutely orchestrated events, and the U.S., with its vast experience in preparing for high-level multilateral meetings, knows the importance of dotting the I's and crossing the T's. But this hasn't stopped recent summits descending into diplomatic and PR disasters for the U.S. Just look at the last summit, held in Cartagena, Colombia, which stayed in the news much longer than anyone expected after Secret Service agents embarrassed the United States by hiring prostitutes and bringing them to their hotel rooms, in violation of basic security protocols. They were reportedly caught after one of the women accused an agent of refusing to pay an agreed fee. As a result of all this, the Americans looked dumb, incompetent -- and cheap. And back in 2009, the President -- new on the job -- was caught flat footed by a fast-talking, fiery anti-American president of Venezuela. The late Hugo Chavez outplayed the leader of the free world, who had just taken office and was trying to show America's new ""outstretched hand"" toward the foe of the George W. Bush era. The summit hit a depressing low for the Obama administration when Chavez walked up to Obama and, as the cameras clicked, handed the American President a copy of the book ""Open Veins of Latin America,"" which blames the region's woes on the U.S. and Europe. Yet the problems in Cartagena weren't just symbolic. Regional leaders lined up against Washington, which had refused to include Cuba in the summit, and vowed they would not hold any more of the gatherings unless Havana was also invited. America was cornered. All this stands in contrast to the optimism of the early Clinton years, when the President issued an invitation to ""democratically elected"" heads of state of Latin America, which was then breaking the chains of military dictatorship. Back then, the U.S. had just led the creation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and actually seemed to stand for something attractive to the region, namely democracy, free trade and economic growth. That's what it should aim for every time: articulating a clear vision and rallying neighbors behind it. Can Obama manage something similar this time? True, the President has come armed with his new Cuba policy. Unfortunately, in an effort to placate critics who say Obama is not doing more for pro-democracy activists, the White House has miscalculated with Venezuela, handing the repressive regime of Chavez's successor, Nicolas Maduro, a stick with which to beat the U.S. Obama has long and rightly ignored Maduro's claims that the U.S. planned to overthrow him. But a modest plan to impose sanctions has suddenly handed Maduro -- who has presided over an economic catastrophe in his country -- a way to portray himself a victim of the U.S., something he will no doubt play that up in Panama. All this risks again reviving memories of past tensions with Latin Americans who already have complicated feelings toward the U.S. over its Cold War support for unseemly right-wing dictators, a policy it claimed to pursue in the name of preventing Soviet-backed communism from taking hold. But those days are behind us. Today, the people want prosperity, they want democracy, and they want the rule of law -- all of which leave a potential opening for the United States. Too many national leaders are eroding democratic norms: Opposition leaders are in prison in Venezuela; a prosecutor who criticized the President was found dead in Argentina; press freedom is under siege in several countries; and corruption is reaching new highs. All of this suggests that if Obama plays his cards right, he will have the opportunity to explain to the people of Latin America that their goals are also America's goals; that like them, he supports democracy, human rights, the rule of law, full freedom of expression and free elections in every country. The fact that he met with Cuban dissidents was welcome, and sends a message that he is not neglecting other issues such as human rights as he recasts relations with Cuba. For the millions in Latin America that still live in poverty, these freedoms can seem like a distant luxury. But if Obama can show them that the United States is a true partner in efforts to improve their lives, then he will leave a longer-lasting legacy in the region than just a handshake.

"(Billboard)Considering the Academy of Country Music Awards celebrated its 50th anniversary on Sunday night at the Dallas Cowboys stadium, it was bound to be bigger than any previous year's ACMs. Plus, as hosts Blake Shelton and Luke Bryan were quick to point out, everything is bigger in Texas. Billboard: 2015 ACM Awards: See All the Photos. But bigger isn't always better. Here's our breakdown of the 10 best and 5 worst moments at the 2015 ACMs. The Best. Eric Church & Keith Urban provide an opening wallop. With a full stadium and millions of home viewers watching, two of country's leading men successfully lit the fuse for the 50th annual ACM Awards with a slick joint kickoff performance. Eric Church's ""Pledge Allegiance To The Hag"" was a fine throwback, but Keith Urban's powerhouse ""Raise 'Em Up"" lived up to its title -- and then some. Setting a Guinness World Record. Not only was this the ACMs biggest audience ever, but the 2015 ACM Awards brought in the biggest audience for a live TV awards show ever. Now that's how you celebrate half a century. Reba McEntire demonstrates how it's done. During a night that found a couple performers sounding a little weak in the vocal department, Reba McEntire showed the entire Cowboys stadium -- and many younger singers who don't have half her energy -- how it's done. Reba is eternal. Taylor Swift singing in the audience. Whether it was during Eric Church or Martina McBride, T-Swift was heating up the audience by singing and swaying along to country staples. Taylor might have gone pop for ""1989,"" but she was deep in the heart of Texas for this annual country extravaganza. Billboard: 2015 ACM Awards: And the Winners Are... Garth Brooks' All-American salute. During Brooks' performance of ""All-American Kid,"" the country giant welcomed a slew of U.S. military representatives into AT&T Stadium, in an emotional moment that put the red, white and blue front and center. Brooks ended the performance by saluting the U.S. armed forces ""who are here and are all around the world for protecting our freedom,"" and also shouted out his home state of Oklahoma, who are grieving 20 years after the Oklahoma City bombing on Sunday. A truly classy moment from one of the best ever. Taylor Swift's mom makes an appearance. Sure, Andrea Swift's presentation of a special award for her daughter came with a fun origin tale about the creation of ""Love Story"" and some lovely words about the 25-year-old superstar. But the sight of the elder Swift -- just days after Taylor confirmed that her mother had been diagnosed with cancer -- walking to the podium was more than enough to yield one of the night's most poignant moments. Christina Aguilera joins Rascal Flatts. Aguilera is far from country, but with a voice as malleable as hers, she can pass for a song or two. After singing a bit of the tune she did while guesting on Nashville, Xtina joined longtime hitmakers Rascal Flatts for ""Riot"" from their recent album ""Rewind."" Aguilera and Gary LeVox trading vocals was the rare unexpected artist pairing that actually worked. Miranda Lambert domination. In addition to kicking ass during her ""Mama's Broken Heart""/""Little Red Wagon"" medley, Lambert justly owned the night when it came to awards. If there's one thing the country community loves more than Miranda Lambert, it's giving Miranda Lambert awards. Billboard: Watch Little Big Town Bring Provocative 'Girl Crush' to ACMs. Little Big Town don't back down. Despite some mild controversy over their song ""Girl Crush,"" Little Big Town brought the poignant ballad to the awards show, giving the ACMs one of its more melancholy moments. Jason Aldean comes on strong. For a night featuring some shaky vocals, Aldean brought his silky yet powerful country croon to the ACMs during a massive medley. It's hard to see an audience get weak in the knees when you're watching at home, but it's fair to assume that's what happened during his performance. The Worst. Tony Romo. The Dallas Cowboys QB was understandably a little stiff on the mic (athletes usually aren't the most charismatic public speakers) but the whole gag with Shelton asking Romo to toss Bryan a pass went on waaaaay too long. On the plus side, Bryan caught the pass. On the other hand, there was a tired play on words about balls. The length. Three hours for the 50th ACMs? Sure, why not. Three and a half hours? That's pushing it. They could have shaved off the last half hour by cutting a couple of the performers who only sang half a song, and shortened a few of the massive commercial breaks. All of the Milestone Awards. Taylor Swift was given an extended honor at this year's ACM Awards, but some of the Milestone Awards -- especially those given to Reba McEntire, Kenny Chesney and George Strait -- seemed rushed for the country giants they were saluting. It's understandable since 2015 is the 50th anniversary of the ACMs, but sometimes, less (recipients) is more. Steven Tyler's facial hair. See link. Twitter calling out Taylor Swift. Plenty of country fans went after T-Swizzle on Twitter, berating her for attending the ACMs after ""abandoning"" country music for pop. The truth is, Swift has just as many country classics under her belt as any other artist in her age range. She might have moved to pop, but don't underplay her importance to the genre that birthed her. ©2015 Billboard. All Rights Reserved.

"Fulham Palace, History, World War I: In 1918, part of the grounds of the palace was converted into allotments, for growing food to help the war effort. The palace itself formed part of Fulham military hospital. After the war, the church found it increasingly difficult to maintain such a large, expensive building. The Bishop of London at the time, Arthur Winnington-Ingram, offered to give up the palace and live in two rooms as he had while the palace was being used ""for the purpose of the National Mission"" (the war effort). However, the bishop was unwilling to let the palace pass into secular hands.","After he left, the palace was used as a military hospital during the First World War.",0,0,0.04059012234210968
"Norfolk, Virginia (CNN)The second mate of the Houston Express probably couldn't believe what he was seeing. Hundreds of miles from land there was a small boat nearby. At first it looked abandoned. It was in bad shape, listing to one side. The crew of the 1,000-foot long container ship thought it was a yacht that had wrecked. Incredibly, as they got closer, they saw there was a man on it, signaling for help. ""He was moving, walking around, waving to us and in surprisingly good condition,"" Capt. Thomas Grenz told CNN by phone Friday. That man, Louis Jordan, 37, had an amazing story. He'd been drifting on the 35-foot Pearson sailboat for more than two months since leaving Conway, South Carolina, to fish in the ocean. Just a few days into his trip, a storm capsized his boat and broke his mast. One of his shoulders was broken, too, so he couldn't fix the boat right away. Eventually he was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, but he could make little headway against the currents. ""It took so long,"" Jordan said.  ""It moved so slowly."" The boat capsized two more times before he was rescued, according to Jordan. His father, Frank Jordan, told CNN's Jim Sciutto that he was expecting his son to look different. ""He looked good. Hadn't lost too much weight. He wasn't badly sunburned like I thought he probably would be,"" he said. Lost at sea for 66 days. After his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival. Collecting fresh water was a nightmare for Jordan.  The weather wouldn't cooperate. Records show there were more than a dozen storms off the coast of the Carolinas during the time he was missing. The precipitation came at night during harsh conditions. ""I had tried to collect (rain)water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat,"" Jordan said.  ""The waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad. ""Finally the conditions were right.  I filled up my water tank, which is 25 gallons.  I filled up a bucket."" Then there was the issue of food. The fish weren't cooperating, but after a while Jordan learned they were attracted to his laundry, which he would put out to sea for a rinse. The fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net, he said. Jordan came ashore Thursday evening. CNN affiliate WAVY in Norfolk, Virginia, reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into Sentara Norfolk General Hospital about 7:30 p.m. Coast Guard officials have said they have found no reason to doubt Jordan's incredible story. They noted that his father contacted them January 29 to report his son and his boat missing. Frank Jordan addressed the skepticism about his son's appearance, saying the boat stayed afloat and upright most of the time. His son spent most of his days in the cabin, out of the sun. Frank Jordan said it was obvious when the Jordans met at the hospital Friday morning that his normally low-key and private son had been through an ordeal. ""I know he went through what he went through,"" Frank Jordan said. Jordan is an unemployed truck driver who lived on his boat at a marina in Conway. He had free rent and free food in the river, he said. But when it became difficult to catch dinner, he took off for the ocean in hopes he would land some bigger fish. Frank Jordan told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday that he had worried about his son, who is an inexperienced sailor, but he held hope because his son had a good boat. And he had the strength to make it. ""He's got a very strong constitution and (is strong) not only physically, but spiritually,"" Frank Jordan said. ""And he told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time, so I believe that sustained him a great deal."" Rescue swimmer Kyle McCollum was the first to care for Jordan on the flight back to land. ""You would expect sunburns, severe sunburn, blisters maybe ... a bunch of medical issues that could possibly be wrong with him,"" he said. ""But for him to be in his current state was pretty amazing."" Grenz was also surprised by Jordan's condition, physically and mentally. The rescued sailor knew almost exactly what day it was, remarkable for someone who had been on the water for more than 60 days. Jordan was dehydrated and said he was hungry. ""We took him to a rescue boat,"" the container ship captain said. ""He was given water and pea soup to gain some power again."" Derriel Morris, a neighbor at the Bucksport Plantation Marina & RV Resort called Jordan a nice guy who loved his 47-year-old boat, named ""Angel."" Morris said: ""It was immaculate, it was gorgeous, beautifully painted. I mean it looked like a brand new sailboat."" Morris told CNN affiliate WPDE that one day in January he was going to the store and Jordan asked him to bring back some coffee creamer. But when he returned to the marina, Jordan had slipped away. ""There was no shore line, no hose; it was like he was never there,"" Morris told the station. After he disappeared others who also live there held a candlelight ceremony. The marina's manager, Jeff Weeks, told WPDE that Jordan is expected to be back at Buscksport next week. Tales of people who cheated death after days, weeks adrift.
","Jordan was eventually spotted by the crew of the Houston Express, a container ship, and was rescued.",1,1,0.7361132502555847

Here's What He's Doing to Help Others. Andrew Nikou built his career using innovative thinking to turn around distressed and neglected companies. Now he turns his attentions toward solving a problem with a global scale: bullying. Image credit: Andrew Nikou Foundation Dan Bova Entrepreneur Staff Editorial Director 20, 2016 7 min read Born to Iranian immigrants, Andrew Nikou grew up outside of Los Angeles, where his dad worked in the city's water and power department. Things weren't easy. The family didn't have a lot of money, and Nikou was the target of harsh bullying in elementary and middle school. ""I was shorter than most of the guys,"" Nikou told Entrepreneur, ""And that bullying had a traumatic effect on me."" With the guidance of his father, Nikou was able to take control of the situation and ultimately turned that trauma into a great motivator. ""My father let me believe that strength wasn't a physical matter, it was an intellectual matter and that allowed me to pave the way to focus on the competitive side of me,"" he says. Related: Use These Green Beret Tactics to Shut Down a Meeting Bully Once that fuse was lit, Nikou's mind for business took off. ""When I was younger, I started trading baseball and basketball cards and began making a lot of money,"" he says. ""When people asked what I wanted to be, I said a CEO. They'd say CEO of what kind of business and I said, 'I don't know, I just want to be a CEO!'"" Nikou was able to rise above his family's tough economic status, went to college, and in 2005, founded OpenGate Capital, a global private equity firm that has amassed $5 billion in total revenues over the firm's 11-year history. The founder spoke with Entrepreneur about his path to success and the initiative he is leading to help others escape the hopelessness brought about by bullying in school and in the workplace. Related: Don't Read This! (It's Only the Most Valuable Psychology Hack You Can Learn) ## Bullying, a global problem ""The problem of bullying is something that is deep in my heart from the experience that I had growing up back in Woodland Hills. I experienced it mostly on the playground, and it left me feeling defeated. It was tough and it was embarrassing, to be honest. So I want to find new innovative ways to confront the bullying challenges we face in classrooms and the workplace, and then, of course, cyberbullying. ""I want to give people the support they need to pivot away from the psychological and physical trauma and build from a positive place of strength."" ## Finding a solution ""This anti-bullying initiative I'm exploring is a collaboration between my charitable organization, The Andrew Nikou Foundation, and XPRIZE, where I am on the Innovation Board. We have some of the greatest minds in many industries -- Elon Musk and Larry Page, to name a few. XPRIZE is trying to use crowdsourcing and incentivizing prizes to solve some of the planet's grandest problems in fields like education, health and technology. And now, bullying. ""I'm going to be the sponsor of the prize. We will put this challenge out to teams, and invite them to present their approaches and projects to the board. The winner of that will receive an incentive prize, which can range in the millions. Related: 9 Iconic Inventors Who Changed the World ""The parameters are not yet set. You can imagine that this problem requires something other than a traditional solution. You're not going to get a bunch of people in a classroom and tell them to read something and say this isn't the right way of behaving. We need more of a disruptive, a more exponential approach to changing the way people behave. Some of the concepts would surely include VR, taking kids and adults who are bullying and putting them in VR settings where they can experience what it feels like to be bullied."" ## The strength of family ""My father's teaching helped me through those tough times when I was a kid. He taught me to be scrappy and smart, to use my brain rather than my muscles. That stayed with me all of these years. My father sacrificed so much for me. He retired early at a very low pay rate so that we could qualify to get grants to go to college. His income was so low at that point that he had to move back to Iran in order to support himself. That was another huge motivator for me to overachieve."" Related: 7 Tips For a Thriving, Sustainable Family Business That Lasts ## The power of friendship ""When we moved to Los Angeles, we became friends with people in the Iranian community and that helped build my confidence and made me stronger. They supported me and gave me strength. I never felt short with my friends -- in fact, I often felt like I was the tallest guy in the room. The loyalty and love I felt from this group, which we called The Persian Pride, rolled into high school and we stayed tight. They were actually the first people to invest in my first deal a decade later. A lot of all this is implanted in the culture of my firm. We're like a big rat pack. Loyalty is the number one most important thing for me."" Related: 12 Low-Cost Business Ideas for Introverts ## One decision can change your life ""When I was a teenager, I wanted to go out with a group of my friends to the movies and my father insisted that I stay home and focus on my studies. We got in the biggest fight that night, but he was insistent. So I stayed home and later that night, some of my friends were gunned down in a drive-by shooting. Several were hit, and one of my best friends was killed. That was really, really tough. I wouldn't be here now if it wasn't for my father."" ## Dealing with bullies in business ""In business, I try to understand where other people are coming from. I try to understand their position, where they came from, what their history is, who their family is. Once you get to a humanistic level, you can really start to see what the truth is. That's worked out really well for me. Sure there is a give and take in every negotiation, but I don't believe that there doesn't have to be a 'winner' and a 'loser.' Everyone can do well in a deal."" Related: 25 Inspiring Entrepreneurs Under 40 ## Ultimate goals ""All of what we're doing, money is just a byproduct. It is important to me that we're not just taking, but that we're giving back. I'm 39, relatively young, so my goal is to look back and not just see that OpenGate was a bunch of financial products, but human products. Anti-bullying is so important to me. And it is not a small feat. It is huge. I want to be the guy they recognize when they talk about anti-bullying."" ## More from Entrepreneur New York Times bestselling author Nicole Lapin can help you pitch your brand to press and strengthen your media training.

"KOSINSKI: The White House slamming Russia's decision to expel 60 American diplomats. The announcement coming from the Kremlin just days after the U.S. booted 60 Russian diplomats to protest the poisoning of a former double-agent and his daughter in the U.K. Press secretary Sarah Sanders calls the expulsions a further deterioration in the United States-Russia relationship, already at a low, and the Trump administration will quote “deal with it.“ So let's go live to Moscow now and bring in CNN's Phil Black. So Phil, sometimes the Russians retaliate for these things. In the past, they haven't. How concerned are Russian officials now that the U.S. is just going to retaliate for this retaliation?
PHIL BLACK, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Russia is saying Michelle that the ball is in your court to the United States because they have chosen to match those expulsions as you detailed there, match the closure of the consulate -- in this case, Saint Petersburg. They believe that's the reasonable response but they say that they will take more action against the United States if the U.S. acts against Russia's interests any further. And the U.S., of course, has said well, we reserve the right to take further actions as well. So it remains to be seen if this draws a line under this current round of tit for tat diplomatic expulsions of whether there is still more action to be seen. But it reinforces what we've come to realize is that this is a historic low in relations between Russia and the United States. Interestingly here, for all the anger directed at the United States over these expulsions there is very little criticism of President Trump himself. There is still a belief here that President Trump would improve relations with Russia if he were allowed to, but Russian officials believe that he is held back -- restricted by an anti- Russian political class in the United States -- Michelle.
KOSINSKI: Yes, this has been a difficult back-and-forth. Thanks, Phil.
BRIGGS: Now let's get a check on “CNN Money“ at 5:49 eastern time. Wall Street closed today for Good Friday.

AT&T's antitrust trial continues and one of the Justice Department's own witnesses may have done damage to its case. The DOJ suing to block AT&T's purchase of Time Warner, the parent of CNN. It claims the merger could hurt rival companies. How? By withholding networks like CNN and HBO during negotiations. But a Comcast exec undercut that argument saying he has no reason to believe the deal would impact future negotiations with Time Warner. Walmart may buy health insurer Humana. That's according to “The Wall Street Journal.“ Now, it's the latest in a recent series of huge health care mergers. Last year, the Justice Department blocked two major tie-ups between insurance companies. It cited antitrust concerns. So now, insurers are seeking different dance partners if you will. For example, CVS pharmacy will buy Aetna. Walmart is already made forays into health care with its pharmacy business but acquiring Humana will give it far greater clout. iPhone users can now turn off a controversial feature that slows down older phones. Apple just updated its mobile operating system and it includes a laundry list of new features and fixes, like the ability to disable a feature that slowed down older phones.

Apple also added some very timely privacy features allowing customers to see all the data Apple collects and what the company uses it for, my friend.

"The number of new HIV infections in a rural Indiana county has grown, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The institute is working with state health leaders to control the ""severe outbreak,"" which has spread among users of a prescription opioid called Opana. The outbreak has been ongoing since mid-December. As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results, all in rural Scott and Jackson counties. This is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people. The CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources. Scott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said. Since the rampant HIV outbreak was first noticed in mid-December, the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources. Indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in March. Indiana University has sent health volunteers to provide a clinic, open once a week to help treat people and test them for HIV. These workers are also going door to door to try to educate the population about the danger of sharing needles. So far, 33 patients have visited the temporary clinic, which is starting to see patients return to seek treatment. It's no coincidence that many of the cases of the newly infected there are younger people ""who weren't around in the '80s and '90s when HIV was at its peak,"" Dr. Jonathan Mermin said. In the 1980s, doctors were seeing an average of 35,000 new HIV infections among IV drug users, and that figure has been down 90% nationally, he said. So people aren't as aware about the danger of sharing needles. Mermin is the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Education will be key, he emphasized. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence also signed a 30-day executive order that allows for a needle exchange. It was set to expire Friday, but he extended the order another 30 days Tuesday. Needle exchanges have been scientifically shown to reduce new infections. The state is also offering job services to people in the area. Dr. Joan Duwve, the chief medical consultant with the Indiana State Department of Health, spoke at length about how communities all along the Ohio River in her state and in Kentucky and West Virginia have seen a huge problem with prescription drug abuse, particularly in areas where there ""is not a lot to do."" Many family members, across generations, live in the same house and will use the drugs together as ""a community activity,"" Duwve said. And this has led to more needle sharing, which spreads infection. She said this has been a problem for these areas for at least a decade. Another reason this infection has spread so rapidly is the nature of the drug itself. Opana, as the prescription opioid is known, needs to be injected more than once a day. Duwve said residents have reported injecting it four to 10 times a day to stay under its influence. When people start to feel the drug wear off after about four hours, they begin to feel sick and go into withdrawal. Often they'll turn to an injecting partner in the same house who will share their needle and their drug to give the person relief from these symptoms. The other problem with this drug is that it requires a larger-gauge needle that exposes users to more blood, which increases the risk of infection. Health leaders worry about the spread of HIV and other diseases such as hepatitis C around the country as the number of illegal prescription drug users has grown. There has been a 150% increase in hepatitis C between 2010 and 2013, the majority of the increase believed to be from injection drug abusers, the CDC said. ""The situation in Indiana should serve as a warning not to let our guard down,"" Mermin said. ""This is a powerful reminder"" that HIV and other infectious diseases ""can gain ground at any time, unless you remain vigilant.""
",The CDC warns that the situation in Indiana serves as a reminder to remain vigilant in preventing the spread of infectious diseases.,1,0,0.2738755941390991

"Molecular cloning is the process used for taking recombinant DNA (referred to as an insert) and placing it into a DNA vector (i.e., plasmid) where it can be replicated and expressed. This process involves multiple steps (such as copying the DNA, cutting out the gene of interest, and pasting the gene into the DNA vector). The final step, ligation (aka the pasting step) is used to seal the insert into the vector. Ligation works by using a phosphodiester bond to connect the sugar backbone of the double-stranded DNA insert with the sugar backbone of the double-stranded DNA vector. This is typically done by using T4 DNA ligase. T4 DNA ligase is an enzyme that helps create the formation of a phosphodiester bond between the 3'-hydroxyl end of a double-stranded DNA fragment and the 5'-phosphate end of the same or another DNA fragment (Figure 1). T4 DNA ligase can catalyze a reaction between blunt-end (no overhangs) or sticky end (3' or 5' complementary single-stranded overhangs) DNA fragments. T4 DNA ligase activity requires Mg2+ and ATP to work, and requires 5'-phosphorylation of one or both fragments.

Figure 1. T4 DNA ligase reaction mechanism.

There are many variables that are necessary to obtain maximum ligation efficiency and accuracy during cloning. As such, the ligation step can fail for numerous reasons, including: Problems related to the ligase enzyme itself (concentration, enzyme stability)

Issues that occur before the addition of T4 DNA ligase (for example, presence of inhibitors including salts, EDTA, proteins, phenol, ethanol, and dATP)

Everything else (molar insert to vector ratio, temperature, buffer composition, etc.) To help your cloning experiment move forward, here are seven tips to help when you encounter DNA ligation failures:

Tip 1: Consider your cloning strategy

Different cloning strategies can be used depending on the type of ends on the DNA fragments you are using (Figure 2).

Sticky ends must be compatible

Cloning is directional

Insert-vector ligation is efficient

Vector self-ligation is low

Recognition sites of ligated restriction enzymes are intact Sticky ends must be compatible

Cloning is directional

Insert-vector ligation is efficient

Vector self-ligation is low

Recognition sites of original

restriction enzymes (e.g., Xhol

and SaII) may be destroyed after

ligation Directional cloning is maintained

Ligation of the blunt ends may be

less efficient Ends are compatible

End sequences are modified

Directional cloning is lost

Ligation may be less efficient

Vector self-ligation is high

The first three panels in Figure 2 illustrate strategies for cloning fragments with distinct sticky ends. These fragments are created when restriction enzymes cut in different places within the double-stranded DNA, resulting in overhangs (unpaired nucleotides). These “sticky ends” can be very helpful and are something that should be considered first when designing your cloning strategy. For example, if you want to clone your DNA insert so that it is read in a specific direction or orientation (also known as directional cloning), sticky end ligation is the method of choice since the created overhangs will only ligate in a specific orientation. Another reason for using sticky ends is to increase your ligation efficiency. When compared with the alternative (blunt-end ligation), sticky end ligation is more efficient due to the compatible overhangs that assist with the ligase reaction. However, it is not always possible to use restriction enzymes that cut in different places to create sticky ends. For those cases, you would choose a blunt-end cloning strategy to ligate your DNA insert into your vector as illustrated in the fourth panel of Figure 2. For this approach, you can either choose a restriction enzyme that will generate blunt ends, or you can generate sticky ends and remove the overhangs by using an end repair kit. Since blunt-end ligation is less efficient than sticky end ligation, this approach will require additional optimization and planning. Using a higher DNA insert to vector ratio is recommended to help ensure ligation of your DNA insert into your vector while preventing vector re-circulization (ligation of your vector without the DNA insert). To further help prevent vector re-circulization, treating the vector with DNA phosphatase helps to remove the 5’-end phosphate groups from the vector before the ligation step.

Tip 2: Check the ends of your DNA inserts

If the DNA inserts you are ligating have blunt ends, the inserts must be 5'-phosphorylated at both ends in order for ligation to occur. If the DNA insert is generated from restriction enzyme digestion, the 5'-phosphate group is already present. However, if your DNA insert is a PCR product created with a proofreading DNA polymerase, your DNA insert will not have a 5’-phosphate group. Therefore, a phosphate group must be added using T4 polynucleotide kinase (T4PNK). When your DNA insert is a PCR product created with a Taq-like DNA polymerase, the resulting PCR product will have deoxyadenosine (dA) protruding ends since Taq DNA polymerases add a single dA to the 3´ ends of PCR products. DNA inserts that have dA ends can be ligated into vectors with complementary overhangs (this is a technique known as TA cloning). If, however, the vector you are using with TA cloning contains blunt ends, then your DNA insert also must be blunted (overhangs removed) before ligation. If the DNA inserts you are ligating have sticky ends, they not only need the 5’-phosphates, but you will also need to make sure that the overhangs (sticky ends) on the inserts are complementary to your vector. If your overhangs are not complementary (ragged ends), your insert will not “paste” to your vector and your ligation will fail. Ragged ends can occur due to incomplete restriction enzyme digestion, elimination of your overhangs by a DNA polymerase that was not removed during purification of your insert, or by contaminating nucleases that might be present in the enzymes used to create the ends of your DNA insert. The best way to determine the problem is by running a set of controls with your experiment (see Tip 6 below).

Tip 3: Set up ideal reaction conditions

In order for the ligation of your DNA insert and vector to work, it is critical to ensure that proper reaction conditions have been set. The ideal ligation reaction conditions are dependent on many factors, including the concentration of reaction components, reaction temperatures, and reaction times. If any of these factors are not optimized, the DNA ends of the insert and vector may fail to anneal frequently enough for ligase to seal the fragments together.

Reaction components

Here’s a recommended ligation reaction protocol that can serve as a starting point for your optimization: Component Amount (sticky end) Amount (blunt end) Vector 20–100 ng 20–100 ng Insert (learn how to calculate insert: vector ratio) x ng x ng 10x ligation buffer* 2 µL 2 µL 50% PEG 4000 solution (blunt ends**) 2 µL 2 µL T4 DNA ligase (sticky ends) 1.0–1.5 Weiss Units T4 DNA ligase (blunt ends) 1.5–5.0 Weiss Units Water, nuclease-free to 20 µL to 20 µL Total volume 20 µL 20 µL Incubation time: Ten minutes to one hour at 22°C * Ligation buffer includes ATP and DTT (a reducing agent), both of which degrade after multiple freeze-thaw cycles or extended incubations. In addition, DTT is prone to degradation during multiple exposures to oxygen, which also occurs through multiple freeze-thaw cycles. Since successful ligation is partly dependent on the correct concentrations of ATP and DTT, it is recommended to freeze ligation buffer in small single-use aliquots to prevent this freeze-thaw degradation.



** Blunt-end ligation is less efficient than sticky end ligation, so a higher concentration of ligase plus a crowding agent like polyethylene glycol (PEG) should be used for faster ligation.

Another optimization step is in the determination of the insert:vector ratio. The equation below can be used to calculate the even molar ratio in nanograms of insert DNA to vector DNA based on length: length of insert (bp) x ng of vector = ng of insert needed for 1:1 insert:vector length of vector (bp) To determine the best ratio of insert:vector to use for cloning, you may have to try different ratios ranging from 1:1 to 15:1, but a 3:1 ratio is a good place to start. For blunt-end ligation, be sure to adjust the insert:vector ratio and increase to 10:1 to optimize your result.

Reaction temperatures

In general, T4 DNA ligase is a temperature-sensitive enzyme. Therefore, reaction efficiency and ligase activity decrease dramatically when the temperature is raised higher than 37°C. The ligation reaction should be incubated at room temperature. To increase reaction rates, the temperature can be cycled between the optimal temperature for the T4 DNA Ligase and the annealing temperature of the overhangs.

Reaction times

In general, prolonged incubation times are not necessary since ligase is a very efficient enzyme. Typically, the ligation should work at room temperature (~22°C) with reaction times ranging from ten minutes to one hour. In rare cases, such as when working with very long DNA fragments, overnight incubations of ligation reactions are necessary.

Tip 4: Avoid inhibitors

Several compounds can inhibit ligation reactions, including salts (like sodium chloride, potassium chloride, ammonium), EDTA, proteins, phenol, ethanol, and dATP. Since these inhibitors can be present in abundance, steps must be taken to either avoid concentrating the inhibitors or removing them from the reaction. It can be tempting to concentrate the amount of vector and insert in your reaction by reducing the final volume (e.g., 10 µL versus 20 µL) of your ligation. However, while this will increase the concentration of DNA present, it may also increase the concentration of inhibitors present in the reaction. In general, a final ligation reaction volume of 20 μL is recommended since this volume includes ~10 μL of pure water (which is added to the reaction) to dilute any inhibitors that are present. In addition, by keeping your glycerol at less than 5% of the final reaction volume, this helps prevent excess glycogen from acting as an inhibitor in the ligase reaction. Another option to deal with inhibitors present in your reaction is to remove them through a DNA purification stop. For this approach, commercially available silica-based columns are the preferred method of choice since the silica particles will not carry over through purification into the ligation reaction. If you choose to use silica matrix particles instead of columns, be aware that residual particles that may carry over can bind the ligase, thereby inhibiting the ligation reaction. If silica matrix particles are your only option, you will need to perform a short centrifugation step prior to the ligation reaction. NOTE: If electrocompetent cells are being used for transformation following ligation, an additional column purification step of the ligated DNA should be used to remove any salt contaminants that may be present and therefore cause damage to your cells during electroporation.

Tip 5: Visualize your ligation reactions on a gel

When your cloning experiment didn’t work, it can be difficult to determine what went wrong. Since the success of your ligation reaction is crucial for cloning success, it is preferred to check your ligation reaction to confirm the insertion of your DNA insert into the vector before moving to the next step in your cloning workflow. The confirmation of ligation reactions can be monitored using agarose gel electrophoresis. To do so, we recommend running the following samples out on a gel: DNA before ligation reaction (e.g., unligated vector plus DNA insert)

DNA after ligation reaction (e.g., ligated vector plus DNA insert) Before running your samples on the agarose gel, mix with an SDS-containing loading dye and incubate at 65°C for ten minutes. Adding the SDS to your loading dye allows for disassociation of ligase from the DNA in the sample, which prevents smearing on the gel. After the ten-minute incubation, run the samples on your gel. If your reaction was successful, the sample containing the ligated products would migrate at a higher molecular weight range than the sample with the unligated products.

Figure 3 illustrates how ligation reaction products may resolve on an agarose gel:

Figure 3. Ligation reaction performed with T4 DNA ligase shown via agarose gel. Lane 1: Vector and insert before ligation. Lane 2: After ligation, loading dye without SDS. Lane 3: After ligation, loading dye with SDS. Lane M: Thermo Scientific GeneRuler DNA Ladder Mix (Cat. No. SM0331).

As shown in the gel, the ligation reaction appears: Lane 1: The bright, clear bands represent the vector and DNA insert before ligation. Lane 2: No SDS results in a smear in the lane as a result of the ligase that remains bound to the DNA. Lane 3: With the addition of SDS, the ligase is no longer bound to the DNA, and clear higher molecular weight bands are seen, representing the ligation products in the reaction. In addition, the vector and DNA insert bands are diminished, indicated that the amount present has decreased. Lane M: The size and approximate amount of ligation product, unligated vector and insert is determined by comparing bands to known size and amount of each band of a DNA ladder used as a marker.

Tip 6: Run controls

Controls are critical components of any experiment. The table below lists common ligation reaction controls that can help track the success of the ligation steps in your cloning workflow. Reaction setup Purpose of the control and interpretation Expected results Uncut vector

(No ligase)

✓ Checks quality and efficiency of competent cells

✓ Verifies antibiotic selection

Several colonies Cut vector

(No ligase)

✓ Determines background from uncut vector

✓ Checks restriction digestion efficiency

Few colonies Cut vector

+ Phosphatase

+ Ligase ✓ Reveals background from any recircularized vector

✓ Checks efficiency of DNA phosphatase treatment

Few colonies Insert or water

+ Ligase ✓Checks for contamination of reagents, stock

solutions, or pipettes

No colonies

Tip 7: Check to make sure your ligase is active

As mentioned previously, T4 DNA ligase is a temperature-sensitive ligase and is inactivated at higher temperatures. If your ligase was stored or shipped improperly, it could be denatured or lose some activity. Since your ligation reaction can fail from due to denatured or impaired ligase, you should always follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for enzyme storage conditions and usage. If you think your ligase may have been denatured or inactivated, check the following: The expiration date on the vial



The ligase activity by using a positive control For example, the commercially available DNA Marker Lambda DNA/HindIII can be used as a positive control. When used in a ligation reaction with T4 DNA Ligase, the band pattern in the sample, when run on a gel, will show a single higher molecular weight band when the ligase is active. If the ligase is not active or is diminished, the original banding pattern of the Lambda DNA/HindIII marker will remain (multiple bands will show on the gel).

Villa are under pressure to make the payment within seven days or face a winding-up order, while the prospect of administration cannot be completely discounted as the club count the cost of missing out on promotion. It is understood Villa were late making the regular tax payment last Friday and though club sources insist the issue will be resolved this week, the West Midlanders are now gripped in a financial crisis. Dr Tony Xia, the owner and chairman, is alleged to be struggling with cash-flow issues in China, which restricts the distribution of money leaving the country. There is no suggestion that Xia is struggling financially. Xia told Villa insiders on Monday that the club is not for sale, yet Steve Bruce's failure to beat Fulham in the Championship play-off final was always likely to have severe ramifications. Xia held crisis talks with Wyness on Tuesday morning and opted to suspend the former Everton chief executive with immediate effect. Chief executive Keith Wyness has been suspended Credit: Wyness was recruited by Xia when he completed his £76m takeover in 2016, but is the first casualty of the play-off final defeat. His departure is not linked to the unpaid tax bill. On Tuesday night it emerged that former Chelsea executive Trevor Birch, who has also worked at Everton and Derby, is now assisting Villa in a bid to help ease their financial worries. Villa's statement read: ""Aston Villa Football Club can confirm that chief executive, Keith Wyness, has been suspended by the club with immediate effect. ""Owner and chairman, Dr Tony Xia will assume the role until further notice. ""There will be no further comment from the club at this time."" As reported by Telegraph Sport on the day of the Wembley final, defeat was always going to leave Villa facing the threat of breaking Financial Fair Play rules. Villa could now look into options such as selling their Recon Training Complex to provide sorely needed cash flow in the short-term, though that would be a last resort. The future of homegrown attacker Jack Grealish, rated at over £30million, will also be thrown into further doubt as the club pursue funds. Villa could look to offload Jack Grealish Credit: Getty images Bruce's future as manager is now increasingly uncertain and he may opt to walk out if the club's finances remain so dire. Last week Xia admitted Villa were facing ""severe"" FFP challenges. He said: ""We have been heavily investing for the past two seasons. However, the loss on Saturday means that we need to change a lot of things. ""No-one wanted to see the club have to go through this, but I believe that only changes can help the club to progress towards the positive direction and this requires the joint efforts of everyone associated with this great football club. ""No matter what the changes will be, I sincerely hope that everyone can unite and overcome the challenges together. ""Our goal has not changed and as long as we believe, regardless of how tough the process will be, I am sure we will succeed in the end."" ### Related Topics HM Revenue & Customs Aston Villa FC Show more If you would like to add a comment, please register or log in Log in Please review our commenting policy ## Football latest 18 Dec 2018, ### Aro Muric spares Raheem Sterling blushes as Man City beat Leicester on penalties to stay in hunt for quadruple 18 Dec 2018, ### Norway Prime Minister 'confirms' Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as new Manchester United manager 18 Dec 2018, ### Steven Gerrard demands Rangers rediscover killer instinct in front of goal 18 Dec 2018, ### Mauricio Pochettino holds all the aces: Tottenham boss wanted by Man Utd and Real... so will he stick or twist? 18 Dec 2018, ### Jose Mourinho stuck in a loop as the 'Special One' became the 'Angry One' and failed to move with the times 18 Dec 2018, ### Burton Albion stun Middlesbrough to reach Carabao Cup semi-finals 18 Dec 2018, ### South American champions River Plate suffer shock Club World Cup exit after losing to UAE's Al Ain on penalties 18 Dec 2018, ### Jose Mourinho sacked by Man Utd as club eyes Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino as long-term successor 18 Dec 2018, ### Why Ole Gunnar Solskjaer could be Manchester United's unlikely saviour after Jose Mourinho's sacking 18 Dec 2018, ### Mind games, bust-ups and hotel bills: Inside story of why Jose Mourinho's Man Utd tenure doomed from day one 18 Dec 2018, ### Why does it always go so wrong for Jose Mourinho in his third season? 18 Dec 2018, ### Jurgen Klopp: Only Man City can stop themselves...we have to play our own game 18 Dec 2018, ### Comment: For Man Utd fans it was the manner of defeats that hurt most... with Jose Mourinho gone, we might get our club back Jim White 18 Dec 2018, ### Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck pens open letter to fans condemning 'unacceptable' actions 18 Dec 2018, ### Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: The managerial CV of Manchester United's likely caretaker 18 Dec 2018, ### Unai Emery urges Arsenal players to show respect against Tottenham 18 Dec 2018, ### Tottenham fan handed ban after throwing banana skin at Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang 18 Dec 2018, ### Mike Phelan in frame to assist caretaker manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at Manchester United 18 Dec 2018, ### Next Manchester United manager latest odds: who will replace Jose Mourinho on a permanent basis? 18 Dec 2018, ### Mauricio Pochettino not ruling himself out of contention to become next permanent Manchester United manager 18 Dec 2018, ### 'United are no longer a football business' - readers react as Man Utd sack Jose Mourinho Voucher codes Sports Direct discount code Nike discount code Sky offers JD sports discount code ### We've noticed you're adblocking.

"China's Military Continues Expansion With New Nuclear-Powered Guided Missile Submarines
China has officially launched its first nuclear-powered guided missile submarines according to the Pentagon. In the short term, the Pentagon has indicated that this means that the Chinese navy ""...will have the ability to conduct long-range precision strikes against land targets from its submarine and surface combatants using land-attack cruise missiles..."" which in turn will enhance China's power projection capabilities wherever China deploys these submarines.
The significance of these new submarines goes back to the Cold War, when the Soviet Union itself engaged in the development of similarly armed submarines to specifically target the aircraft carriers of the United States. Given widespread concerns that China might well be considering an invasion of Taiwan given the preoccupation of the United States with the war ongoing between Russia and Ukraine, as well as the potential for the outbreak of a regional war in the Middle East as the result of the conflict continuing to unfold between Israel and Hamas, the fact that these submarines are coming into service in the Chinese navy now is something the military of the United States is likely observing closely.
Unfortunately, the recent report by the Pentagon regarding developments in the Chinese military offer additional causes of concern beyond the additional of these new submarines to the Chinese navy. Other things mentioned include a projection of nearly 1000 nuclear warheads being operation by 2030, up from a count of 500, as well as the construction of new silo fields that could host more than 300 new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) silos. There was even commentary on how China might well be exploring the possibility of developing conventionally armed intercontinental-range missile systems that would allow strikes against the United States. With all these developments occuring simultaneously with the continued expansion of the Chinese navy, already the largets in the world by number of ships and submarines at 370, to an estimated 435 by 2030, the simulated attack operations and rhetoric coming from China aginst Taiwan should be taken seriously going forward.","These developments coincide with China's expanding navy, now the largest in the world, which is expected to grow to 435 ships and submarines by 2030.",1,1,0.9733095169067383

"It's no surprise which image is making the headlines from this week's gathering of leaders from nearly three dozen nations in Panama: A historic handshake between President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro. But this first meeting of Obama and Castro since they announced plans to start normalizing diplomatic ties should not be the end of the summit story. Or at least Obama is hoping it won't be. After all, the President has had some unhappy experiences at hemispheric summits, where the headlines have often focused on some less than flattering moments. The reality is that the United States has been losing ground in this increasingly important region, and Obama needs to put on a strong performance in Panama at the Summit of the Americas if the U.S. is to have a chance of improving ties with neighbors who should be best friends, but who have drifted away as America has been focused on challenges at home and instability in the Middle East. Unfortunately, America has lost influence in Latin America to a hyperactive China, a cunning Russia and a troubling Iran, all of which have made inroads in the region at Washington's expense. This gathering therefore offers a chance for the U.S. to reverse the tide and build on the potential offered by a natural alliance strengthened by millions of people with Latin American and Caribbean blood who make their homes in the United States. The foundations for a strong hemispheric bloc are there. But they need attention, and the Panama meeting offers a good opportunity to start building. But first: Do no harm. Large diplomatic gatherings are minutely orchestrated events, and the U.S., with its vast experience in preparing for high-level multilateral meetings, knows the importance of dotting the I's and crossing the T's. But this hasn't stopped recent summits descending into diplomatic and PR disasters for the U.S. Just look at the last summit, held in Cartagena, Colombia, which stayed in the news much longer than anyone expected after Secret Service agents embarrassed the United States by hiring prostitutes and bringing them to their hotel rooms, in violation of basic security protocols. They were reportedly caught after one of the women accused an agent of refusing to pay an agreed fee. As a result of all this, the Americans looked dumb, incompetent -- and cheap. And back in 2009, the President -- new on the job -- was caught flat footed by a fast-talking, fiery anti-American president of Venezuela. The late Hugo Chavez outplayed the leader of the free world, who had just taken office and was trying to show America's new ""outstretched hand"" toward the foe of the George W. Bush era. The summit hit a depressing low for the Obama administration when Chavez walked up to Obama and, as the cameras clicked, handed the American President a copy of the book ""Open Veins of Latin America,"" which blames the region's woes on the U.S. and Europe. Yet the problems in Cartagena weren't just symbolic. Regional leaders lined up against Washington, which had refused to include Cuba in the summit, and vowed they would not hold any more of the gatherings unless Havana was also invited. America was cornered. All this stands in contrast to the optimism of the early Clinton years, when the President issued an invitation to ""democratically elected"" heads of state of Latin America, which was then breaking the chains of military dictatorship. Back then, the U.S. had just led the creation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and actually seemed to stand for something attractive to the region, namely democracy, free trade and economic growth. That's what it should aim for every time: articulating a clear vision and rallying neighbors behind it. Can Obama manage something similar this time? True, the President has come armed with his new Cuba policy. Unfortunately, in an effort to placate critics who say Obama is not doing more for pro-democracy activists, the White House has miscalculated with Venezuela, handing the repressive regime of Chavez's successor, Nicolas Maduro, a stick with which to beat the U.S. Obama has long and rightly ignored Maduro's claims that the U.S. planned to overthrow him. But a modest plan to impose sanctions has suddenly handed Maduro -- who has presided over an economic catastrophe in his country -- a way to portray himself a victim of the U.S., something he will no doubt play that up in Panama. All this risks again reviving memories of past tensions with Latin Americans who already have complicated feelings toward the U.S. over its Cold War support for unseemly right-wing dictators, a policy it claimed to pursue in the name of preventing Soviet-backed communism from taking hold. But those days are behind us. Today, the people want prosperity, they want democracy, and they want the rule of law -- all of which leave a potential opening for the United States. Too many national leaders are eroding democratic norms: Opposition leaders are in prison in Venezuela; a prosecutor who criticized the President was found dead in Argentina; press freedom is under siege in several countries; and corruption is reaching new highs. All of this suggests that if Obama plays his cards right, he will have the opportunity to explain to the people of Latin America that their goals are also America's goals; that like them, he supports democracy, human rights, the rule of law, full freedom of expression and free elections in every country. The fact that he met with Cuban dissidents was welcome, and sends a message that he is not neglecting other issues such as human rights as he recasts relations with Cuba. For the millions in Latin America that still live in poverty, these freedoms can seem like a distant luxury. But if Obama can show them that the United States is a true partner in efforts to improve their lives, then he will leave a longer-lasting legacy in the region than just a handshake.
","Obama has announced a new policy towards Cuba, but this has sparked criticism from some lawmakers and led to a miscalculation with Venezuela, which could undermine US efforts.",1,0,0.003818765515461564
"We want our killers to be kind. To walk into court and show remorse, tell us that they are really nice people who only did it because they feared for their lives, or they were temporarily insane. Even though those things may not be true, too often they are accepted as legitimate excuses for murder. Well, Aaron Hernandez, the former New England Patriots tight end and now convicted murderer, made none of those excuses. He walked into court with an air of bravado, his head held high like the $40 million, NFL superstar he was just a couple of years ago. Several times he was even caught winking at his fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, during the trial. And we didn't like his swagger. Hernandez didn't offer a plausible alibi. He didn't look ashamed or remorseful. He never wept. His own attorney, James Sultan, admitted that Hernandez ""witnessed"" the killing of Odin Lloyd, ""committed by somebody he knew,"" but said his client did not commit the crime. Even before the guilty verdict came down Wednesday, for many -- at least those covering the trial -- audacity seemed to be the defendant's biggest crime. ""The Arrogance of Aaron Hernandez,"" a New Yorker headline accused. I don't get it. What does it matter that Hernandez was arrogant in court, or walked with too much swagger, or even smiled at his girl? Like it or not, that is who he is. The evidence is what matters. And for once, this time it appears the jury carefully considered the damning mountain of circumstantial evidence against this defendant and came to the right decision: guilty of first-degree murder in the 2013 slaying of Odin Lloyd. Hernandez, 25, was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. He was also found guilty of unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition. It was the right decision. Still, it's hard not to feel sadness over such a senseless waste of life for both Lloyd and now Hernandez, who were once friends. Football was the best thing Hernandez ever had, especially after he father died suddenly after a routine hernia surgery in 2006. Hernandez was 16. After that his life got complicated. At 17, Hernandez went off to the University of Florida and seemed headed for greatness. There he won the John Mackey Award as the nation's best tight end and led the team in receiving during its 2009 Bowl Championship Series win. But off the field, his life was to beginning to unravel. Trouble started: bar fights, reports of marijuana use and failed drug tests. He was even questioned in relation to a shooting after a fight at a Gainesville, Florida, nightclub. By the time he was drafted in 2010 by the New England Patriots, Hernandez had already been labeled a ""troubled player."" But neither the Patriots nor the NFL has anything to be ashamed of in how they handled the Hernandez case. They did everything right this time. Hours after Hernandez was charged with murder, he was let go from the team. And his coaches didn't spend any time trying to convince the public that their star tight end was a decent, family-loving guy, as the league has done too many times in the past when its players got in trouble. This time justice worked. There's no reason to second-guess what went wrong, to ask ""How could a star NFLer be a murderer?"" The NFL for the most part does a great job vetting its players, and certainly Hernandez is an anomaly in the league, where despite the ugly headlines, the overwhelming majority of players are upstanding, law-abiding citizens. And Patriots bashers (me included) would be mistaken to try to find fault with the team for drafting Hernandez despite his troubled past. No one really knows what evil lurks in the hearts of others, even those closest to us. Not the mothers whose sons go off and commit schoolyard killing sprees, or wives whose husbands gun down innocent people, and certainly not employers who are mostly concerned about performance on the job. There was no way to predict Hernandez would end up a murderer. He was a guy who had all the talent and opportunity in the world, but he still went wrong. Hernandez himself may have explained it best as he was being taken out of the courtroom:. According to a law enforcement source close to the case, Hernandez told officers escorting him, ""'Hey man, I'm going to miss you guys. ... I don't need any luck any more.' He gave you the impression, 'It's kinda like no big deal. ... It is what it is.' ""

"Big Brother 25 spoilers: Houseguests talk about regretting Cameron eviction
Cameron Hardin got backdoored on Big Brother 25 to wrap up Week 10.
The house was united in its goal to get him out, mostly because he kept winning challenges.
Cameron also had difficulties connecting with some of the players, which Felicia Cannon was fond of noting.
At one point, Felicia even accused Cameron of having an “evil spirit” inside him.
The remaining houseguests played in a new HOH Competition following Cameron’s eviction.
And the result was a Secret HOH taking the power.
Choices of Secret HOH lead to eviction regrets
Jag Bains is the Secret HOH. He took the power by winning a BB Comics challenge.
As anticipated, Jag continued his plan to get Blue Kim out right after Cameron left.
Jag nominated Blue and Felicia for eviction, but it was done secretly, so the ladies were frustrated and upset.
Felicia was seen on the Big Brother live feeds saying she missed Cameron because he was at least upfront about things.
Cirie Fields agreed with Felicia, but Cirie also knows Jag is the Invisible HOH.
The other houseguest expressing that she missed Cameron was Blue. Everything Cameron warned her about happened in less than 24 hours.
Before he got sent to the jury house, Cameron warned Blue that she was the next target and that Jag and Matt Klotz were coming after her. She never fully believed his story but changed her mind after immediately seeing the block.
What’s to come on Big Brother 25?
A Double Veto takes place in Week 11 of Big Brother 25.
Here is an explanation of the Big Brother Double Veto, but a summary is that it will heavily impact the game.
Someone will join Cameron in the jury house very soon, but fans must tune in to the upcoming episodes to find out who.
Blue has a chance to save herself, and she must, especially with the trash talk she dished out to Cameron in her Diary Room sessions.
The live feeds showed that Blue went to Matt and asked what Cameron had said, wondering about the truth.
Below is a clip from that conversation, where Blue was given many context clues about what was coming.

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN)Sitting on a sunny bench in Istanbul's Gezi Park, Fadime Gurgen dismisses the controversy surrounding the 100th anniversary Friday of the massacre of Armenians under the Ottoman Empire with a wave of her hand. Gurgen, a 55-year-old cleaner, says her family has had close friendships with Armenians going back generations. ""There is no such thing as genocide,"" she says. ""Other people are trying to create hostility between us."" Most Turks agree with Gurgen. Ninety-one percent of Turks do not believe that the events of 1915 -- when, according to Armenians, 1.5 million ethnic Armenians were systematically killed in the final years of the Ottoman Empire -- were genocide, according to a recent poll. It's a sentiment shared by the Turkish government, which denies that a genocide took place, maintaining that hundreds of thousands of Turkish Muslims and Armenian Christians died in intercommunal violence around the bloody battlefields of World War I. Turkey also disputes Armenia's count of the numbers killed, putting it at 300,000. It's a heavily disputed position -- the killings are widely viewed by scholars as genocide and the Armenian government and diaspora are lobbying for wider recognition in the international community. Armenian Prime Minister Hovik Abrahamyan said Friday in statement that Turkey's Ottoman rulers had planned and carried out a ""monstrous crime"" in the years of World War I and called on more countries to recognize and condemn the genocide. Many Armenians living in Turkey still feel treated as second-class citizens. However many have hope that Turkey's younger generation is more willing to accept that a genocide occurred than their parents. ""Students are much, much more liberal,"" says Diana Van, whose grandparents escaped the mass killings. Van is a member of the delegation for the Armenian Genocide commemoration and is writing her Masters thesis on the issue at Ankara University. ""They have access to alternative information written in English, which is not taught in school (in Turkey). With more access to books, to alternative information, and with a larger democratization process, Turkey will be able to face its history."" A century after her Armenian ancestors escaped death in Eastern Turkey, Van says she is frustrated that Turkey is unwilling to accept what happened. ""Your identity is denied by Turkey,"" she says. ""They do not want to face this past. In Turkey, the word Armenian is still used as a curse. Whenever you want to hurt somebody, you say, 'you are like an Armenian.'"" Van says an admission of genocide by Turkey would largely be symbolic. While her grandparents lost their land, she has returned to their villages and she recognizes that trying to reclaim it would be impossible. ""I do not believe that this is going to happen,"" she says of the territorial claims made by many Armenians. ""One hundred years have passed. I went to my ancestors' land, and I saw those Armenian lands full of Kurdish people, who have five to 16 children per family, and I saw that it's not Anatolia. It's not my homeland that I had in my imagination."" A growing number of scholars and world leaders believe that what happened should be called genocide. Germany looks set to join the European Parliament, France, Austria, Canada and some 20 other countries in labeling the atrocity a ""genocide."" Two weeks ago the Pope referred to mass killings as ""the first genocide of the 20th century"" -- a move that infuriated Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who called the claim ""nonsense"" and recalled his ambassador to the Vatican. Some notable countries do not recognize the killings as genocide, including the UK and Israel and earlier this week U.S. President Barack Obama, wary of damaging relations with Turkey amid growing unrest in the Middle East, did not use the word genocide. There are several reasons why Turkey maintains its position on the issue. Turks say that to most people there the term ""genocide"" is associated with Nazis -- not the beloved founders of modern Turkey. Last year, the Turkish government expressed condolences to Armenians, and accepted that hundreds of thousands of their ancestors died as they were marched out of cities and towns in Central and Eastern Anatolia in the waning years of the Ottoman Empire. But the government called it a ""necessary deportation"" during the messy and violent period of transition leading up to World War I -- when many Armenian radicals were threatening to side with Russia. Turkey says that there was never a deliberate, ethnically-driven effort to exterminate the Armenian population. ""It was a wartime precaution, like the U.S. relocated the Japanese population during World War II,"" says Dr. Kamer Kasim, Dean of Abant Izzet Baysal University. Kasim dismisses the drive for the ""genocide"" label as little more than a propaganda campaign being waged by the Armenian diaspora. Politics and timing is another issue. At a time when President Erdogan is in full campaign mode ahead of upcoming parliamentary elections, he is attempting to assuage concerns about unemployment and slowed growth by drumming up nationalist fervor with promises of a ""New Turkey"" akin to the glory days of the Ottoman Empire. It's hardly the time to label the country's founders as murderers. That wouldn't play well with Turks, many of whom have gone through years of schooling that instilled in them a fierce pride in their past. In the same way that American schools often whitewashed the history of U.S. settlers and their relations with Native Americans, Turkish schools have long taken an airbrush to the ""Young Turks."" The movement, which began in 1908, was comprised of the army officers who were in power as the country transitioned from the hands of spoiled sultans to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk -- the much-adored leader who came to power in 1923 and is credited with founding the modern Turkish state. The taboo surrounding the use of the word genocide began to crack about a decade ago when two of Turkey's best-selling international authors, Orhan Pamuk and Elif Safak, joined other intellectuals in raising the issue of whether the country's forefathers had committed genocide. Pamuk and Safak were met with crushing resistance. They were harangued in the court of public opinion, and tried in real-life court on charges of ""insulting Turkishness."" Since 2003, Turkish schools have been forbidden from using the term genocide. Calling the events of 1915 a genocide would undermine the very narratives the Turks hold most dear, says Burcu Gultekin Punsmann, a senior analyst at Ankara Policy Center who has studied Turkish-Armenian relations for a decade. She says the country simply isn't ready to dismantle the foundation it was built on, or stain the legacy of its founders. ""Turkey is still too young and too insecure to rewrite its history and question the events unfolding at the establishment of the republic,"" Punsmann says. But in a statement issued to mark the anniversary of the killings, President Erdogan urged dialogue, saying ""...As descendants of two ancient peoples who a hundred years ago shared the same destiny whether in joy or in sorrow, our common responsibility, and calling, today is to heal century old wounds and re-establish our human ties once again. Turkey will not remain indifferent to this responsibility and will continue to do its utmost for friendship and peace."" But there are other issues, including fears that an official recognition of genocide could unleash a flood of lawsuits against the Turkish government. In 2006, descendants of exiled Armenians filed suit in a U.S. court against two German banks for restitution of assets, based on evidence that Ottoman ministries required that seized Armenian assets be turned over to the government and transferred to banks in Germany. One 97-year-old Armenian woman living in the U.S. claims to have land deeds proving that her parents owned land that now houses an airport. Her case is winding its way through the Turkish court system, but her lawyer, Ali Elbeyoglu, says the genocide debate has no effect: ""We have deeds, so we are following the law and politics don't matter."" Others say that the genocide is distracting the country from more pressing issues between Turkey and Armenia, like the closed border between the two hostile neighbors. Aybars Gorgulu, a foreign policy expert at TESEV, one of Turkey's leading think tanks, argues that it is Armenia, not Turkey, which suffers most from the tensions surrounding the issue. And he says it isn't in Armenia's best interest to push hard for a recognition of genocide that he doesn't believe will ever come. ""There's no diplomatic relations between the countries, and that plays into why Turks think there's a crazy diaspora obsessed with genocide, but that's not true,"" Gorgulu says. ""The best thing for Armenia would be to enter into dialogue with Turkey, normalize relations, and open the border."" Meanwhile, the publicity surrounding the anniversary on Friday has prompted debate amongst Turks of all ages. On Sunday there will be a conference at Bogazici University on the atrocity -- one of few in Turkey that openly uses the term genocide. Nisan Gul Goker, a 21-year-old art management student with bright pink lipstick, is one of the few Turks who believes that her country should change course. ""They keep referring to this as an 'Armenian incident' in quotations and can't call it genocide,"" she says, boarding the metro to her classes at Aydin University. ""We should be ashamed of this and accept it.""

"If there's one thing that hurts more than the saddle sores from cycling around China for 460 days, it's having the bike you did it on stolen just days before completing your epic trip. That's what happened to cyclist Wang Pingan as he neared the end of a two-wheel trek that covered thousands of miles through every major province in the vast country, according to local media. Arriving in the southern city of Shenzhen, in southern Guandong province, Wang locked up his trusty mountain bike, loaded with panniers, to check out electronics markets in the city's Huaqiangbei area. Within 10 minutes the thieves struck. But here's where the story takes an unexpected turn. Despite police initially saying odds were stacked against the bike ever being recovered, Shenzhen's finest managed to track it down and return it. The Southern Metro News reported that police apprehended an alleged criminal and sent Wang a photo of a bike they recovered. He recognized it instantly. They said the theft, from a road junction ""infested"" by cycle thieves was caught on surveillance cameras. The bike had likely been sold twice before being recovered. ""We don't want this lad visiting Shenzhen and having a bad memory of the city,"" a police spokesman told the paper. Now, with 29,200 kilometers under his tires, Wang can continue the final few days of his epic journey. He'll be able to add his final destination, Hainan Island, to a route that has already taken in some of the country's most far-flung places. Among them are Mohe in Heilongjiang, China's northernmost and coldest place, Urumqi in the west and Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture in the southwest.. Wang, a recent university graduate, who embarked on his trip with a budget of little more than $100, had earlier turned down offers from across China to help him get a new bike, vowing to walk if he couldn't be reunited with his ""old lover."" ""It has a special meaning to me,"" he said, according to SMN. Before the bike's recovery, Wang had posted a heart-rending tribute to his bike on social media, recalling their adventures together. ""The bicycle itself doesn't have a high value, but spending more than a year with it, it's like a best friend who has accompanied me on my way, and taken me to every place without complaints,"" he writes. ""Thank you, my buddy, maybe I'll never see you again ... I remember I cried during the difficult times at the beginning of the trip and you were by my side."" CNN's Shen Lu, Maggie Hiufu Wong and Barry Neild contributed to this story.

"TITLE: Former military official ""instigated Rwandan genocide"" | Amnesty International  PUBLISHED DATETIME: 2008-12-19T00:00:00 Skip To Main Content Amnesty International Amnesty International Main menu Justice Systems # Former military official ""instigated Rwandan genocide"" 19 December 2008, 00:00 UTC A former senior defence official was convicted on Thursday of instigating Rwanda's 1994 genocide and committing crimes against humanity and war crimes. Theoneste Bagosora was sentenced to life in prison by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). Former military commanders Anatole Nsegiyumva and Alloys Ntabakuze were also found guilty of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, and given life sentences. A co-accused, General Gratien Kabiligi, was acquitted of all charges. Theoneste Bagosora and the others convicted have the right to appeal their convictions. The ICTR said that Theoneste Bagosora and the two co-defendants led a committee that plotted the massacre of ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus. More than 800,000 people were killed in Rwanda's genocide. Amnesty International said that the conviction of Theoneste Bagosora is welcome news to the survivors of the Rwandan genocide. ""Theoneste Bagosora's conviction sends a strong signal that those who planned and committed acts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity will be brought to justice,"" said Tawanda Hondora, Deputy Director of Amnesty International's Africa Programme. ""There can be no impunity for such serious crimes, whether committed in Rwanda or anywhere else in the world. ""It is important to stress, however, that there are many others still walking the streets who took part in the Rwandan genocide. Many of them are living in exile,"" added Tawanda Hondura. ""The international community must complement the work of the UN Tribunal by arresting and prosecuting all those against whom there is evidence that they took part in the genocide. The trials must be fair and must meet international standards of fair trial."" The ICTR is due to wind up its operations in 2010. Amnesty International has called on the ICTR, and especially the Office of the Prosecutor, to ensure that it deals with all the outstanding cases, without prejudice to the accused persons' rights to a fair trial. In addition, Amnesty International also called on the ICTR to ensure that it immediately prosecutes members of the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF), who are also suspected of having committed war crimes and crimes against humanity before, during and after the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. Amnesty International documented numerous killings by RPF forces during this period, but the ICTR, which was established to prosecute crimes committed by individuals regardless of affiliation, has not prosecuted a single member of the RPF or their civilian superiors in the past 14 years. ## Topics Justice Systems Armed Conflict War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity International Justice Keywords or Title Amnesty Index Number Date (year) Bahasa Melayu Монгол хэл azərbaycan dili Tiếng Việt қазақ тілі","Amnesty International has confirmed that the RPF committed war crimes and crimes against humanity, but the crimes have largely escaped international notice.",0,0,0.00992730911821127

"[1] The main culprit is aspargusic acid, which is found exclusively in asparagus. When asparagus is digested, asparagusic acid gets broken down into sulfur containing byproducts. Sulfur, in general, is not very pleasant to smell, notes Dr. Bobart. When you pee, the sulfur byproducts evaporate almost immediately, causing you to smell that unpleasant scent.It’s worth noting that asparagus isn’t the only thing that can change the smell of your pee. Other foods and drinks have been known to cause smelly urine. For example, some people report that drinking too much coffee causes their urine to smell like coffee. Brussels sprouts, onions and garlic have also been linked to odd smelling pee in some people.Asparagus pee usually shows up between 15 and 30 minutes after eating the vegetable and can last for several hours. One study found that the smell could last for up to 14 hours!

[2] Asparagus urine odor has been observed for centuries. So before you start wondering if something is wrong with you, rest assured asparagus pee is a totally normal bodily reaction.Depending on what study you read, it’s estimated that between 20% to 50% of people experience it. For those who don’t get to encounter the joy of asparagus pee, researchers believe the reason might be two-fold: 1. Everyone digests food differently and some people can break down the sulfur byproducts more efficiently.
2. Some people lack the ability to detect the odor simply because of genetic variations.

[3] Asparagus is notorious for making urine smelly. But if this veggie doesn't give your pee a funky odor, that's normal, too.Dr. Dutta says everyone digests food differently, and some can get away with eating asparagus without any change in their urine. ""It's most likely because their body doesn't have the enzyme they need to break it down completely,"" she explains. But others do have the enzyme, and when those people digest asparagus, ""their bodies make something called a sulfur metabolite, which can make the urine have a sulfur or ammonia smell.""
Other foods, like Brussels sprouts, onions, garlic, curry, salmon, and alcohol, can have a similar effect.","Asparagus contains a compound called asparagusic acid, which is responsible for its distinct flavor and odor.",0,0,0.3133414387702942

The ""burger"" was served on a doughy, barely cooked pita-like bread rather than on an appropriate item to hold a messy burger in place like a brioche bun.  It was completely falling apart after a few bites... which would have been okay to eat with a fork except it was just not flavorful or complex given the list of ingredients. The most interesting item was the ketchup made from beets.  Also the side fries weren\'t thoroughly cooked except for the smallest ones.  Definitely not a $24 item! The empanadas were somewhat better but again, not a \'wow\' and not even a \'hey, really tasty.\' Just bland and again, not worth $24.  The half-off discount didn\'t even cover the $13 cost of a chai tea and lemonade (that was mostly ice of course).  All in all, very disappointing food and therefore completely overpriced.

"I'm haunted by the video of Officer Michael Slager firing eight shots at Walter Scott as he fled his encounter with North Charleston police -- his back turned to the officer. What I find more disturbing is how the officer cuffs the fallen Scott and allows him to die face-down in the dirt while Slager appears to plant an item next to his body. I understand why people are skeptical of self-defense claims -- especially from law enforcement. If not for the video taken by a bystander, I can't help but think that this story would be shuttered behind the wall of an active investigation. As a defense attorney, I am more sensitive than anyone to the assumption of innocence for those accused of a crime, but this single piece of evidence -- a video of a man shot in the back while in full retreat -- defies any reasonable explanation. Thank God there was a camera. It will help ensure that justice will be served in this case. However, there is another camera that -- had it been deployed -- might have prevented the entire tragedy: a police body camera. Throughout the entire encounter with Scott, it's clear Slager had no idea someone was filming him. Had he known there would be video of his every move, would he have drawn his weapon on a fleeing man?  Would he have fired?  Eight times?  Would he have misrepresented the encounter on his police report? Of course not. If Slager had been wearing a body camera, Scott would probably still be alive, and Slager wouldn't be facing the possibility of life in prison -- or a possible death sentence. Body cameras are expensive to deploy, sure. And storing the massive amounts of data that body cameras create costs even more. That cost, however -- if we're talking the monetary kind -- may be eclipsed by the punitive damages delivered to Scott's family in an inevitable civil suit against the North Charleston Police Department. Most importantly, we have to ask ourselves this: What's the value of a human life? Certainly it's worth the price of some mass data storage. And there's something else at stake. The public is losing confidence in law enforcement, and the strained relationship between minorities and police is reaching a breaking point. Every police shooting that captures headlines justifies an ever increasing fear of cops in the street. As fear ratchets up, so does the tension between cops and the people in the communities they serve. As tension rises, the risk of more shootings increases. It is a cycle of destruction that could lead to chaos. Police body cameras can help break this cycle. Studies have shown that both cops and people in the community act better when they know they are on camera. Complaints against cops decrease, and, most importantly, use-of-force incidents drop. I will admit that body cameras are only an interim solution. They only help compensate for the real underlying problem, which is this: There is a bias against black men that has infiltrated the criminal justice system, and we are seeing it in the disproportionate shooting of black men. When we look at this footage -- and when we see the dashboard camera from the other South Carolina officer who last year shot a man who was reaching for his driver's license -- it's clear that many cops are more likely to interpret actions, even routine actions, from black men as potentially aggressive. These may not be overtly racist cops. They may not intentionally treat black men differently, but we can't pretend that black men aren't being disproportionately targeted. All across the country, we see it happening, and with the proliferation of video, we're seeing it happen with alarming frequency. Somehow, we're going to have to beat this bias out of our system. Set tougher employment screening standards when hiring cops. Institute more training to help officers recognize the bias and adjust for it. As a society, we have to focus on the broad social changes needed to address disparities in income, education and opportunities -- disparities that keep us a racially divided nation. But social change, sadly, may take generations of hard work. In the meantime, if we can't immediately root out racial bias, we can at least put a bright spotlight on it, and we can start by focusing on the one interaction where racial bias results in the loss of life -- we can start by placing body-mounted cameras on cops.

"[1] One theory is that the rings formed at the same time as the planet and its major moons. In this case, if material is close to the planet, the planet’s gravitational pull is too strong to coalesce into a moon and the particles that would otherwise form a moon spread out in orbit around the planet as a ring.Another idea is that a close call by a moon or comet results in the planet’s gravitational tidal force breaking up those bodies, the debris of which then becomes a ring system.

[2] The answer seems to be that there are small moons orbiting ringed planets at or near the distance from the planets as the rings themselves, and that these moons are needed to keep the rings from flying apart. So, basically, having enough moons the right distance from the planet makes rings possible.

[3] At present, scientists aren’t entirely sure how these ring systems came about. They may have formed from leftover material from the formation of the planet, or be the remains of a moon that was destroyed by an impact or simply broken apart by the gravitational force of the parent planet.

[4] Scientists are also unsure why only the gas giants have rings. They think it may be related to the same process that resulted in gas giants forming only in the outer Solar System while rocky planets formed only in the inner Solar System. It is thought that the energy given off by the infant Sun expelled most of the light gases and other volatile molecules from the inner regions of the Solar System, leaving heavier elements able to form inner rocky planets. This process also seems to have made it easier for the outer planets to form moons.
So, the combination of large gravitational forces, the existence of volatile materials such as ices and the shepherding of material by numerous moons probably mean the outer planets were far more likely to form and keep planetary rings.","Another idea is that a close pass by a moon or comet can break it up, and the debris can form a ring system.",1,1,0.9827281832695007

"The American Pharmacists Association is discouraging its members from participating in executions. On Monday, the group voted at its annual meeting to adopt a ban as an official policy, stating that ""such activities are fundamentally contrary to the role of pharmacists as healthcare providers."" This bolsters the association's previous positions to oppose the use of the term ""drug"" for chemicals used in lethal injection and to oppose laws that require or prohibit pharmacists from participation in lethal injection cases. The group acted this week because of increased public attention on lethal injection, said Michelle Spinnler, spokeswoman for the American Pharmacists Association. That spotlight includes a January Supreme Court decision to stay the execution for three death row inmates in Oklahoma. This was prompted by Clayton Lockett's execution by lethal injection nearly one year ago in which he writhed on a gurney for 43 minutes before he died from a heart attack. In Georgia last month, the execution of female death row inmate Kelly Renee Gissendaner was postponed as a precaution when the execution team checked the medications and discovered they looked cloudy. Thirty-two sates allow capital punishment, and lethal injection is still the most common method. Last month, Utah Gov. Gary R. Herbert signed a law reinstating firing squads as a method of execution in cases in which lethal injection medications are not available. Of the eight inmates currently on death row in Utah, three opted for the new choice of death by firing squad. Pentobarbital is the preferred drug used for lethal injection. In Texas, the department of criminal justice told CNN in March they are running out of their supply. In July 2011, Lundbeck Inc., the manufacturer of pentobarbital, decided to no longer provide the drug to prisons for use in capital punishment. The companies that manufacture the products traditionally used in executions almost unilaterally decided to stop selling to institutions that used the products for that purpose, so states then turned to compounded preparations, Spinnler said. ""Pharmacists should not be involved in preparation of these products or involved in executions in any other way."" she says. The new declaration by the American Pharmacists Association aligns with positions held by other professional medical organizations such as the American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association and the American Board of Anesthesiology.
","The move comes amidst controversy over lethal injection methods and drug availability, with some states considering alternative methods such as firing squads.",1,1,0.9655694961547852
"Savannah Chrisley and new boyfriend Robert Shiver double date with Grayson Chrisley and girlfriend
Savannah Chrisley is enjoying life with a new man by her side.
The Chrisley Knows Best star revealed she was seeing former Auburn player Robert Shiver last month, and now she is double dating with her brother, Grayson Chrisley, and his girlfriend.
Over the weekend, the Chrisley siblings took in a Zach Bryan performance, where the couples wore matching shirts.
It was a moment that allowed Savannah to be herself in the midst of the chaos that has been her life over the last over the last year.
Seeing the Unlocked with Savannah Chrisley podcast host spending time with someone and being in a serious dating situation hasn’t happened since she was on and off with her ex-fiance, Nic Kerdiles.
Robert may be a newer man, but she is already gushing over him.
Savannah Chrisley enjoyed weekend double date
Hitting the town with her younger brother, Grayson Chrisley, was something Chrisley Knows Best viewers didn’t see coming.
Savannah Chrisley took guardianship over him and their younger sister/niece, Chloe, last November ahead of their parents, Todd and Julie Chrisley, reporting to federal prison.
Grayson grew up on the hit reality TV show, and knowing he is almost an adult is a wild concept. But Savannah was ready to spend time with him and his girlfriend as she and Robert Shiver attended Zac Bryan’s concert with Grayson and his girlfriend.
Savannah Chrisley gushes over Robert Shiver
After announcing she was seeing someone on Nick Viall’s podcast, Savannah Chrisley’s new beau was identified as Robert Shiver.
While doing press for FOX’s Special Forces: World’s Toughest Test, the Growing Up Chrisley star talked about her relationship with her new guy, gushing about him the entire time.
Savannah said, “I obviously went on a podcast and spilled my guts and now I laugh and I’m like, ‘Alright, no more drinking lime before a podcast.’ I’ve learned my lesson there. But this is a relationship that I’m like, ‘I want to protect and love and even who knows where it’s going to end up,’ but even if it [didn’t end] up as The One, I am so grateful to have met [him].”
She also went on to say that “God knew” what they both needed. Robert has children, which helps because Savannah is very serious about being there for her siblings. She is their guardian and the constant in their lives, so it’s important she is dating someone who understands.
Whether this relationship lasts remains to be seen, but Robert must be divorced before they can move toward anything super serious.","Savannah has been open about her feelings for Robert, saying that she wants to ""protect and love"" him and that their relationship is something she's grateful for.",1,0,0.05581893399357796

"It's not easy being the Pope. Not only does he shepherd nearly 1 billion Catholic souls, he also leads a small but morally significant state with envoys and interests in nearly every country. As scholars like to say, the Vatican has walked the line between spiritual and worldly concerns for centuries. Sometimes, as when St. John Paul II stood up to Communist Poland, the church's moral and political clout have combined to pack a powerful punch. At other times, popes have to make a hard choice: Adopt the sharp tongue of a prophet or the discretion of a diplomat? This Sunday in Rome, Pope Francis faced just such a dilemma. First, the back story:. One hundred years ago, more than 1 million Armenians (some estimates run as high as 1.5 million) died at the hand of the Turks. Many of the victims were part of a branch of Christianity closely aligned with Catholicism. A slew of  historians and at least 20 countries call the killings a ""genocide."" (A U.S. resolution to do the same has languished in Congress.) Turkish officials disagree, arguing that the deaths, while unfortunate, were part of a long-running war that witnessed casualties on all sides. For their part, previous popes had finessed the genocide question. John Paul II used the ""g"" word in 2001, but didn't dare speak it out loud. Instead, it was tucked into a document signed by the former pontiff and the head of the Armenian church, after they had celebrated Mass together. Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI called the killings ""a great evil"" and ""terrible persecution"" in a speech 2006, but avoided labeling them genocide. (Benedict found other ways to tick off the Turks, initially opposing their entry into the European Union.) As Pope Francis prepared to celebrate a special Mass Sunday to commemorate a century since the slaughter,  Vatican watchers were divided about whether he would use the word ""genocide."" He did, but in a roundabout way, by quoting John Paul's document. ""In the past century, our human family has lived through three massive and unprecedented tragedies,"" Francis said. ""The first, which is widely considered 'the first genocide of the 20th century,' struck your own Armenian people."" The middle phrase comes directly from the document issued 14 years ago by John Paul. In citing his predecessor, Francis highlighted one of the Vatican's chiefest concerns, especially on matters of moral import: continuity. Whether holding the line against artificial birth control, declining to ordain female priests or dealing with diplomatic tensions, it sometimes seems as if the church considers inconsistency the most unforgivable of sins. ""The Vatican and the papacy love continuity,"" said the Rev. Thomas Reese, a Vatican analyst for National Catholic Reporter. If Francis had not called the Armenian killings a genocide, particularly at such a high-profile event -- the audience included Armenia's President -- it might have been interpreted as a change in church policy, Reese said. At the same time, Francis didn't want to anger the Turks more than necessary, especially since they have become a key ally against the persecution of Christians by ISIS in the Middle East, which the Pope alluded to in his speech on Sunday. ""The fact that he quoted John Paul is a sign that he's downplaying it,"" Reese said of the Armenian murders. ""He's telling people: There's nothing new here."" New or not, Turkey was not happy. The nation recalled its Vatican ambassador for ""consultations"" just hours after Francis' comments, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said. Turkey also promptly summoned his counterpart, the Vatican's ambassador, for a meeting, Turkish state broadcaster TRT reported. In a tweet Sunday, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called the Pope's use of the word ""unacceptable"" and ""out of touch with both historical facts and legal basis."" ""Religious authorities are not places through which hatred and animosity are fueled by unfounded allegations,"" the tweet reads. ""Hatred"" and ""animosity"" are not words often used to describe Pope Francis. Because he often shines a sympathetic face on the world, emphasizing mercy over judgment, it's easy to miss the bluntness Francis brings to the bully pulpit. On matters of doctrine and diplomacy, he may be carrying on Catholic traditions, but in his willingness to engage in geopolitics and the tone that engagement often takes, this pope is decidedly different. He has helped broker a backroom detente between the United States and Cuba, and invited Israeli and Palestinian leaders for an unprecedented prayer service at the Vatican (after annoying some Israelis with an impromptu prayer at the wall that separates the West Bank from Jerusalem.) But Francis has also suggested that force may be justified to stop ISIS' slaughter of Christians, warned of the ""Mexicanization"" of Argentina and said that satirists who insult religion should expect a retaliatory punch. On Monday, the Pope addressed a roomful of priests at morning Mass. He must have heard the hubbub about his ""genocide"" remark, but he encouraged his charges to speak frankly, without fear, and to bear the courage of their convictions, just as the early apostles had. ""We cannot keep silent about what we have seen and heard,"" Francis said. CNN's Gul Tuysuz  and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.

"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Open defecation is the human practice of defecating outside (""in the open"") rather than into a toilet . People may choose fields, bushes, forests, ditches, streets, canals, or other open spaces for defecation. They do so either because they do not have a toilet readily accessible or due to traditional cultural practices. [2] The practice is common where sanitation infrastructure and services are not available. Even if toilets are available, behavior change efforts may still be needed to promote the use of toilets. 'Open defecation free' (ODF) is a term used to describe communities that have shifted to using toilets instead of open defecation. This can happen, for example, after community-led total sanitation programs have been implemented.
Open defecation can pollute the environment and cause health problems and diseases. High levels of open defecation are linked to high child mortality , poor nutrition , poverty , and large disparities between rich and poor. [3] : 11 Ending open defecation is an indicator being used to measure progress towards the Sustainable Development Goal Number 6 . Extreme poverty and lack of sanitation are statistically linked. Therefore, eliminating open defecation is thought to be an important part of the effort to eliminate poverty. [4]
As of 2019 an estimated 673 million people practice open defecation, [5] : 74 down from about 892 million people (12 percent of the global population) in 2016. [6] In that year, 76 percent (678 million) of the people practicing open defecation in the world lived in just seven countries. [6]
In ancient times, there were more open spaces and less population pressure on land. It was believed that defecating in the open causes little harm when done in areas with low population, forests, or camping-type situations. With development and urbanization, open defecating started becoming a challenge and thereby an important public health issue, and an issue of human dignity . [7] With the increase in population in smaller areas, such as cities and towns, more attention was given to hygiene and health. As a result, there was an increase in global attention towards reducing the practice of open defecation. [8]
Open defecation perpetuates the vicious cycle of disease and poverty and is widely regarded as an affront to personal dignity. [3] The countries where open defecation is most widely practiced have the highest numbers of deaths of children under the age of five, as well as high levels of undernutrition , high levels of poverty, and large disparities between people of means and the poor.

Open defecation in India
The term ""open defecation"" became widely used in the water, sanitation, and hygiene ( WASH ) sector from about 2008 onwards. This was due to the publications by the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) and the UN International Year of Sanitation . The JMP is a joint program by WHO and UNICEF that was earlier tasked to monitor the water and sanitation targets of the Millennium development goals (MDGs); it is now tasked to monitor Sustainable Development Goal Number 6 .
For monitoring of the MDG Number 7, two categories were created: 1) improved sanitation and (2) unimproved sanitation . Open defecation falls into the category of unimproved sanitation. This means that people who practice open defecation do not have access to improved sanitation.
In 2013 World Toilet Day was celebrated as an official UN day for the first time. The term ""open defecation"" was used in high-level speeches, that helped to draw global attention to this issue (for example, in the ""call to action"" on sanitation issued by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations in March 2013). [9]
""Open defecation free"" (ODF) is a phrase first used in community-led total sanitation (CLTS) programs. ODF has now entered use in other contexts. The original meaning of ODF stated that all community members are using sanitation facilities (such as toilets) instead of going to the open for defecation. This definition was improved and more criteria were added in some countries that have adopted the CLTS approach in their programs to stop the practice of open defecation. [10]
The Indian Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation in mid-2015 defined ODF as ""the termination of fecal-oral transmission , defined by:
- No visible feces found in the environment or village and
- Every household as well as public/community institutions using safe technology option for disposal of feces"". [11]
Here, a ""safe technology option"" means a toilet that contains feces so that there is no contamination of surface soil, groundwater or surface water ; flies or animals do not come in contact with the open feces; no one handles excreta; there is no smell and there are no visible feces around in the environment. [12] This definition is part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Campaign).
The reasons for open defecation are varied. It can be a voluntary, semi-voluntary or involuntary choice. Most of the time, a lack of access to a toilet is the reason. However, in some places even people with toilets in their houses prefer to defecate in the open. [10]
A few broad factors that result in the practice of open defecation are listed below.
- Lack of infrastructure: People often lack toilets in their houses, or in the areas where they live. [5] [13]
- Lack of toilets in other places: Lack of toilets in places away from people's houses, such as in schools or in the farms leads the people to defecate in the open. [13] Another example is a lack of public toilets in cities, whether by a reluctance among businesses to allow patrons to use their toilets or limited hours (e.g. if there are no 24-hour businesses in town and someone needs to use the toilet after regular business hours), which can be a big problem for homeless people . [14]
- Use of toilets for other purposes: In some rural communities, toilets are used for other purposes, such as storing household items, animals, farm products or used as kitchens. In such cases, people go outside to defecate. [15] [16]
- Poor quality of toilet: Sometimes people have access to a toilet, but the toilet might be broken, or of poor quality – outdoor toilets (pit latrines in particular) typically are devoid of any type of cleaning and reek of odors. Sometimes, toilets are not well lit at all times, especially in areas that lack electricity. Others lack doors or may not have water. Toilets with maggots or cockroaches are also disliked by people and hence, they go out to defecate. [17] [18] [19] [13]
- Risky and unsafe: Some toilets are risky to access. There may be a risk to personal safety due to lack of lights at night, criminals around them, or the presence of animals such as snakes and dogs. Women and children who do not have toilets inside their houses are often found to be scared to access shared or public toilets, especially at night. [19] [20] Accessing toilets that are not located in the house might be a problem for disabled people, especially at night. [21] In some parts of the world, Zambia for example, very young children are discouraged from using pit latines due to the risk of them falling through the open drop-hole. In such cases when there is no other available sanitation facility, children are encouraged to practice open defecation. [22]
- Presence of toilet but not privacy: Some toilets do not have a real door, but have a cloth hung as a door. In some communities, toilets are located in places where women are shy to access them due to the presence of men. [23] [21] [13]
- Lack of water near toilet: Absence of supply of water inside or next to toilets cause people to get water from a distance before using the toilet. [13] This is an additional task and needs extra time.
- Too many people using a toilet: This is especially true in the case of shared or public toilets. If too many people want to use a toilet at the same time, then some people may go outside to defecate instead of waiting. In some cases, people might not be able to wait due to diarrhea (or the result of an Inflammatory Bowel Disease emergency).
- Fear of the pit getting filled: In some places, people are scared that their toilet pits will get filled very fast if all family members use them every day. So they continue to go out to delay the toilet pit filling up. This is especially true in the case of a pit latrine. [19] [21]
- Lack of awareness: People in some communities do not know about the benefits of using toilets. [24] [25]
- Lack of behavior change : Some communities have toilets, yet people prefer to defecate in the open. [10] In some cases, these toilets are provided by the government or other organizations and the people do not like them, or do not value them. They continue to defecate in the open. Also, older people are often found to defecate in the open and they are hesitant to change their behavior and go inside a closed toilet. [13]
- Prefer being in nature: This happens mostly in less populated or rural areas, where people walk outside early in the morning and go to defecate in the fields or bushes. They prefer to be in nature and the fresh air; instead of defecating in a closed space such as a toilet. [4] There may be a cultural or habitual preference for defecating ""in the open air"", beside a local river or stream, or even the bush.
- Combining open defecation with other activities: Some people walk early in the morning to look after their farms. Some consider it a social activity, especially women who like to take some time to go out of their homes. While on their way to the fields for open defecation they can talk to other women and take care of their animals. [13]
- Social norms : Open defecation is a part of people's life and daily habits in some regions. For instance, a 2011 survey in rural East Java , Indonesia, found that many men considered the practice ‘normal’, and having distinct benefits such as social interaction and physical comfort. [26] In some cultures, there may be social taboos where a father-in-law may not use the same toilet as a daughter-in-law in the same household. [ citation needed ]
- Social or personal preferences: Open defecation is a preferred practice in some parts of the world, with many respondents in a survey from 2015 stating that ""open defecation was more pleasurable and desirable than latrine use"". [26]
- In some societies, open defecation is an intentional means of fertilization which is widely-used.
- Fecal incontinence : This medical condition can result in abrupt 'emergencies' and not enough time to access a toilet.
In developed countries , open defecation can be due to homelessness . Open defecation in developed areas is also considered to be a part of recreational outdoor activities such as camping in remote areas. It is difficult to estimate how many people practice open defecation in these communities.
The practice of open defecation is strongly related to poverty and exclusion particularly, in the case of rural areas and informal urban settlements in developing countries . The Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) of UNICEF and WHO has been collecting data regarding open defecation prevalence worldwide. The figures are segregated by rural and urban areas and by levels of poverty. This program is tasked to monitor progress towards the millennium development goal (MDG) relating to drinking water and sanitation. As open defecation is one example of unimproved sanitation , it is being monitored by JMP for each country, and results are published on a regular basis. [28] [6] The figures on open defecation used to be lumped together with other figures on unimproved sanitation but are collected separately since 2010.
The current estimate is that around 673 million people practice open defecation. [5] : 74
The number of people practicing open defecation fell from 20 percent in 2000 to 12 percent in 2015. [6] : 34 In 2016, the estimate was for 892 million people with no sanitation facility whatsoever and therefore practicing open defecation (in gutters, behind bushes, in open water bodies, etc.). Most people (9 of 10) who practice open defecation live in rural areas, but the vast majority lives in two regions ( Central Africa and South Asia ). [6] In 2016, seventy-six percent (678 million) of the 892 million people practicing open defecation in the world lived in just seven countries. [6]
Some countries with large numbers of people who openly defecate are listed in the table below.
|Country||Total population||Percentage and Number of people who defecate in the open||Other estimates (based on government-provided data or other sources)|
|Cambodia||16,949,415||17% or 2.8 million (2021) [29]|
|Chad||16,244,513||69% or 11 million (2018) [30]|

15% or ~209.4 million(World Bank 2020) [32] 48% or 594 million(according to UNICEF) [33]
The National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey of India reported that 96.5% of rural households in India had toilets. The Indian government's own estimate in January 2019 was 1.4% or 19 million. [34] [35] [36] [37] According to World Bank, 15% Indians practice open defecation [38]
|Indonesia||270,203,917||9% or 25 million (2020) [ citation needed ] } [39]|

Open defecation is widely practised in India. Globally, India has the largest number of people, close to 594 million which is 48% of Indians practise open defecation. [44] About half the population of India use toilets. [45] With 44 per cent of mothers disposing their children’s faeces in the open, there is a very high risk of microbial contamination (bacteria, viruses, amoeba) of water which causes diarrhea in children. [46] Although access to sanitation in rural India is improving, the increase is not equitable. Open defecation is still almost universal among the poorest 20% of India. [47] A report published by WaterAid stated that India had the highest number of people without access to basic sanitation despite efforts made by the Government of India under the Swachh Bharat Mission. [48] [49] About 522 million people practiced open defecation in India in 2014, despite having access to a toilet. [50] [51] Many factors contributed to this, ranging from poverty to government corruption. [52]
Since then, through Swachh Bharat , a two-phase program managed by the Indian government, India has constructed around 100 million additional household toilets which would benefit 500 million people in India according to the statistics provided by Indian government (Phase 1: 2014–2019, Phase 2: 2020 to 2025). [53] A campaign to build toilets in urban and rural areas achieved a significant reduction in open defecation between 2014 and 2019. In September 2019, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded Indian leader Narendra Modi for his efforts in improving sanitation in the country. [54] According to UNICEF The number of people without a toilet reduced from 550 million to 50 million. [55] [56] There have also been reports of people not using the toilets despite having one, although according to the World Bank , 96% of Indians used the toilets they had. [57] [58] In October 2019, Modi declared India to be ""open defecation free"", though this announcement was met with skepticism by experts who cited slowly changing behaviors, maintenance issues, and water access issues as obstacles that continued to block India's goal of being 100% open defecation free. [59] [60]
Although open defecation still continues, it has been reduced by a large amount. With the success of the Swachh Bharat Mission , Modi has to launch Phase 2 from 2020 to 2025. [61] During phase 2 the government will focus on segregation of waste and further eliminating open defecation in the country. [62]
In 2017, WaterAid report revealed that 79 million people in Pakistan lacked access to a decent toilet in the country. [63] [64] In 2018, 10% or 22 million people in Pakistan practiced open defecation according to the figures provided by the UNICEF . [65] [66] According to the latest UNICEF report as of 2020, 7% or 15 million people in Pakistan practice open defecation. [42]
In San Francisco (United States), open defecation complaints for street feces increased fivefold from 2011 to 2018, with 28,084 cases reported. This was mainly due to the rising amount of homelessness in the city. [67] Similar problems were reported in Los Angeles [68] and Miami . [69]
The Mad Pooper was the name given to an unidentified woman who regularly defecated in public places while jogging during summer 2017 in the U.S. city of Colorado Springs . [70]
The negative public health impacts of open defecation are the same as those described when there is no access to sanitation at all. Open defecation—and lack of sanitation and hygiene in general—is an important factor that cause various diseases; the most common being diarrhea and intestinal worm infections but also typhoid , cholera , hepatitis , polio , trachoma , and others. [71] [72]
Adverse health effects of open defecation occur because open defecation results in fecal contamination of the local environment. Consequently, open defecators are repeatedly exposed to many kinds of fecal bacteria like gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and other fecal pathogens, and this is particularly serious for young children whose immune systems and brains are not yet fully developed. [26]
Certain diseases are grouped together under the name of waterborne diseases , which are diseases transmitted via fecal pathogens in water. Open defecation can lead to water pollution when rain flushes feces that are dispersed in the environment into surface water or unprotected wells .
Open defecation was found by the WHO in 2014 to be a leading cause of diarrheal death. In 2013, about 2,000 children under the age of five died every day from diarrhea. [73]
Young children are particularly vulnerable to ingesting feces of other people that are lying around after open defecation, because young children crawl on the ground, walk barefoot, and put things in their mouths without washing their hands. Feces of farm animals are equally a cause of concern when children are playing in the yard.
Those countries where open defecation is most widely practiced have the highest numbers of deaths of children under the age of five, as well as high levels of malnourishment (leading to stunted growth in children), high levels of poverty, and large disparities between rich and poor. [3]
Research from India has shown that detrimental health impacts (particularly for early life health) are even more significant from open defecation when the population density is high: ""The same amount of open defecation is twice as bad in a place with a high population density average like India versus a low population density average like sub-Saharan Africa."" [74]
Open defecation is also badly affecting the health of children and their life quality as it creates health and psychological issues. [75]
There are strong gender impacts connected with a lack of adequate sanitation. In addition to the universal problems associated with open defecation, having to urinate in the open can also be problematic for females. The lack of safe, private toilets makes women and girls vulnerable to violence and is an impediment to girls' education. [76] Women are at risk of sexual molestation and rape as they search for places to urinate or defecate that are secluded and private, often during hours of darkness. [77] [76]
Lack of privacy has an especially large effect on the safety and sense of dignity of women and girls in developing countries. They face the shame of having to urinate or defecate in public so often wait until nightfall to relieve themselves. They risk being attacked after dark, though it means painfully holding their bladder and bowels all day. [78] [79] Women in developing countries increasingly express fear of assault or rape when having to leave the house after dark. Reports of attacks or harassment near or in toilet facilities, as well as near or in areas where women urinate or defecate openly, are common. [78] [79]
The following joint strategies can enable communities, both rural and peri-urban , to become completely open defecation free and remain so: Sanitation marketing, behavior change communication , and 'enhanced' community-led total sanitation ('CLTS + ’), supplemented by 'nudging'. [26]
There are several drivers used to eradicate open defecation, one of which is behavior change. SaniFOAM (Focus on Opportunity, Ability, and Motivation) is a conceptual framework that was developed specifically to address issues of sanitation and hygiene. Using focus, opportunity, ability and motivation as categories of determinants, SaniFOAM model identifies barriers to latrine adoption while simultaneously serving as a tool for designing, monitoring and evaluating sanitation interventions. [80] [81] The following are some of the key drivers used to fight against open defecation in addition to behavior change: [4]
- Political will
- Sanitation solutions that offer a better value than open defecation
- Stronger public sector local service delivery systems
- Creation of the right incentive structures
Efforts to reduce open defecation are more or less the same as those to achieve the MDG target on access to sanitation . [82] A key aspect is awareness-raising (for example via the UN World Toilet Day at a global level), behavior change campaigns, increasing political will as well as demand for sanitation. Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) campaigns have placed a particular focus on ending open defecation by ""triggering"" the communities themselves into action. [83]
There are some simple sanitation technology options available to reduce open defecation prevalence if the open defecation behavior is due to not having toilets in the household and shared toilets being too far or too dangerous to reach, e.g., at night.
People might already use plastic bags (also called flying toilets ) at night to contain their feces. However, a more advanced solution of the plastic toilet bag has been provided by the Swedish company People who are producing the ""Peepoo bag"", a ""personal, single-use, self-sanitizing, fully biodegradable toilet that prevents feces from contaminating the immediate area as well as the surrounding ecosystem"". [84] This bag is now being used in humanitarian responses, schools, and urban slums in developing countries. [85] [86]
Bucket toilets are a simple portable toilet option. They can be upgraded in various ways, one of them being urine diversion which can make them similar to urine-diverting dry toilets . Urine diversion can significantly reduce odors from dry toilets . Examples of using this type of toilet to reduce open defecation are the ""MoSan"" [87] toilet (used in Kenya) or the urine-diverting dry toilet promoted by SOIL [88] in Haiti.
The mainstream media in some affected countries have recently been picking up on this issue of open defecation, for example, in India [89] [90] and Pakistan. [91] [92] [93]
In certain jurisdictions, open or public defecation is a criminal offense which can be punished with a fine or even imprisonment. [94] [95] [96]
David Sedaris ' essay ""Adventures at Poo Corner"" dealt with people who openly defecate in commercial businesses. [97]
Some national parks prohibit open defecation in some areas. [98] [99] If defecating openly, the general advice is to defecate into a dug hole, and cover with soil. [99]","Even if toilets are available, behavior change efforts may still be needed to promote their use.",1,1,0.9812073111534119
"The views were expressed following a meeting of the EU Negotiation Joint Ministerial Committee in London.
Mr Davis said the UK government would keep Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland up-to-date about negotiations.
However, Mr Russell said transparency about UK government plans was needed.
Mr Davis said he wanted to hold a monthly meeting to share analysis as part of a ""two-way information flow"" with each of the three nations.
He believed that would allow the devolved administrations to voice their views as the Westminster government prepares talks with Brussels.
Mr Davis said: ""Today's meeting was an important step in bringing the devolved administrations together with the UK government to discuss how we can work together to get the best deal for the whole of the UK.
""Naturally, there are different standpoints around the table, but the meeting was constructive and amicable. We will meet regularly and share our latest thinking as the UK shapes its negotiating strategy.
""We will work positively with the Scottish government, the Welsh government and the Northern Ireland Executive as we implement the decision of the people of the UK to leave the EU.""
Mr Russell said it was ""good"" that the process of involving the Scottish government was under way.
But he added: ""More than four months after the referendum the UK government has still not made its strategic intentions clear.
""There was a discussion over EU market access but we do not know whether UK ministers want to remain inside the single market or the customs union. This will remain a considerable problem as we continue to promote the interests of Scotland.
""The UK Government must provide greater clarity and transparency on its intentions.""
He said he made it ""absolutely clear"" that membership of the single market ""is essential for the economic prosperity of Scotland"".
The UK government hopes the High Court judgment on how Article 50 will be triggered will be overruled on appeal to the Supreme Court next month.

"In this section, causation in fact and legal causation are examined as well as situations where the defendant may be insulated from criminal responsibility.Causation in Fact Every causation analysis is twofold. First, the defendant must be the factual or but for cause of the victim’s harm. The but for term comes from this phrase: “but for the defendant’s act, the harm would not have occurred” (Del. Code Ann. tit. II, 2011). As the Model Penal Code states, “[c]onduct is the cause of a result when…(a) it is an antecedent but for which the result in question would not have occurred” (Model Penal Code § 2.03(1)(a)). Basically, the defendant is the factual or but for cause of the victim’s harm if the defendant’s act starts the chain of events that leads to the eventual result. Example of Factual Cause Henry and Mary get into an argument over their child custody agreement. Henry gives Mary a hard shove. Mary staggers backward, is struck by lightning, and dies instantly. In this example,",This involves proving that the defendant's action initiated a chain of events that led to the eventual harm suffered by the victim.,1,1,0.8339613676071167

"The California Public Utilities Commission on Thursday said it is ordering Pacific Gas & Electric Co. to pay a record $1.6 billion penalty for unsafe operation of its gas transmission system, including the pipeline rupture that killed eight people in San Bruno in September 2010. Most of the penalty amounts to forced spending on improving pipeline safety. Of the $1.6 billion, $850 million will go to ""gas transmission pipeline safety infrastructure improvements,"" the commission said. Another $50 million will go toward ""other remedies to enhance pipeline safety,"" according to the commission. ""PG&E failed to uphold the public's trust,"" commission President Michael Picker said. ""The CPUC failed to keep vigilant. Lives were lost. Numerous people were injured. Homes were destroyed. We must do everything we can to ensure that nothing like this happens again."" The company's chief executive officer said in a written statement that PG&E is working to become the safest energy company in the United States. ""Since the 2010 explosion of our natural gas transmission pipeline in San Bruno, we have worked hard to do the right thing for the victims, their families and the community of San Bruno,"" Tony Earley said. ""We are deeply sorry for this tragic event, and we have dedicated ourselves to re-earning the trust of our customers and the communities we serve. The lessons of this tragic event will not be forgotten."" On September 9, 2010, a section of PG&E pipeline exploded in San Bruno, killing eight people and injuring more than 50 others. The blast destroyed 37 homes. PG&E said it has paid more than $500 million in claims to the victims and victims' families in San Bruno, which is just south of San Francisco. The company also said it has already replaced more than 800 miles of pipe, installed new gas leak technology and implemented nine of 12 recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board. According to its website, PG&E has 5.4 million electric customers and 4.3 million natural gas customers. The Los Angeles Times reported the previous record penalty was a $146 million penalty against Southern California Edison Company in 2008 for falsifying customer and worker safety data.

"[1] * Stocks, or shares of a company, represent ownership equity in the firm, which give shareholders voting rights as well as a residual claim on corporate earnings in the form of capital gains and dividends.
* Stock markets are where individual and institutional investors come together to buy and sell shares in a public venue. Nowadays these exchanges exist as electronic marketplaces.
* Share prices are set by supply and demand in the market as buyers and sellers place orders. Order flow and bid-ask spreads are often maintained by specialists or market makers to ensure an orderly and fair market.

[2] A stock market is a place where licensed people, or brokers, go to buy and sell stock in a company.
How does that stock get there and why do people want to own it?
First, a company needs to be listed on a market like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), based on Wall Street, for people to be able to trade its shares.
A company will choose to list its shares to the public usually in order to raise cash to invest in the business activities and it's called an IPO, or initial public offering.
When this happens, the company sells off slices of the business so anyone is able to buy a piece and the company receives the money.

[3] Companies sell stock, or partial ownership in the company, to investors in order to raise money. And as those companies increase or decrease in value, the value of your investment will rise and fall.

[4] The stock market works through a network of exchanges — you may have heard of the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq. Companies list shares of their stock on an exchange through a process called an . Investors purchase those shares, which allows the company to raise money to grow its business. Investors can then buy and sell these stocks among themselves, and the exchange tracks the supply and demand of each listed stock.
That supply and demand help determine the price for each security, or the levels at which stock market participants — investors and traders — are willing to buy or sell.
Buyers offer a “bid,” or the highest amount they’re willing to pay, which is usually lower than the amount sellers “ask” for in exchange. This difference is called the bid-ask spread. For a trade to occur, a buyer needs to increase his price or a seller needs to decrease hers.
This all may sound complicated, but computer algorithms generally do most of price-setting calculations. When buying stock, you’ll see the bid, ask, and bid-ask spread on your broker's website, but in many cases, the difference will be pennies, and won’t be of much concern for","Investors purchase those shares, which allows the company to raise money to grow its business.",1,1,0.9833805561065674

"Speaker 3: Okay. Item six, click or read item six.
Speaker 4: This is a report from the city manager with the recommendation to authorize the city manager execute documents with Global Green for professional technical assistance to conduct a sustainable neighborhood assessment for the historic Virginia Village Market Street Neighborhood District eight.
Speaker 3: Straws.
Speaker 5: Yes, Mr. Mayor, thank you very much. I pulled this item because I think it is worthy of our hearing here in the public. This is a endeavor that is very important to North Lawn Beach communities, particularly those neighborhoods surrounding the Market Avenue corridor. I wanted to let staff report exactly on what this Global Green Initiative is actually all about. And so I turn it over to the city manager.
Speaker 8: Mayor. Councilmember Andrews This is a project that's very near and dear to Councilmember Austin's heart. And I'm going to turn it over to our sustainability manager, Larry Rich, to tell us what's happening. Thank you, Mr. West. Good evening, Mayor, and members of the Council. One of the things that we do in the Office of Sustainability is always looking for grant opportunities to pursue either for funding or, in this case, technical assistance. And so and this particular grant opportunity, the organization Global Green reached out to us and invited us to apply for a program that they're doing that's called the Sustainable Neighborhood Assessment. This is the third year of their program. In the past two years, they've selected in each of the years, seven or eight other cities around the country. This year they were looking for another seven or eight cities. And so Long Beach applied. We in working with the Development Services Department and looking into previous planning efforts, we selected a neighborhood in in the eighth District in the vicinity of Market Street and the Virginia Village right there at Market and Language Boulevard. And so what this is all about is we previously interacted with Global Green to create our green building policy for both municipal development and private development. And in that policy, we use a tool called the Lead Checklist LEED being leadership in energy and environmental design. So at this point in the city of Long Beach, we've got more than 30 LEED certified buildings, some of which are city owned facilities such as Fire Station 12 or the gas and oil building that was recently completed. There's a there's a different product that we're not as familiar with that's called LEED for Neighborhood Development. So over the course of this grant technical assistance, we will be doing a assessment of this neighborhood around Market Street with a mind to what sort of strengths the neighborhood has, what sort of green opportunities exist. And we will be provided with a report and assessment at the end of the process that will make recommendations to the city about how it might proceed with development projects in that neighborhood to introduce green elements such as pedestrian friendliness, stormwater improvements, open space linkages and so on. The technical assistance involves an intensive three day site visit by the Global Green Experts, where we'll do. A city team will be assembled to work with the Global Green team. We'll do a walk the neighborhood to get a feel for what's going on, on the ground, review the existing plans that have been completed for the area, run through the the lead for neighborhood development checklist to review opportunities there, hold a couple or a stakeholder meeting and also a an evening community input meeting and then tie all that information together in what I've seen done for the other cities that have completed this process, a 20 to 25 page report that then comes back to the city and it'll be on us to implement recommendations that are made in that report. So that's a kind of a quick overview of what we're talking about for this neighborhood. We're excited in the Office of Sustainability because, as I said, we don't necessarily have experience with the lead for neighborhood development tool. So it'll be a good learning experience for city staff and hopefully we'll pick up some things through this process that will be applicable to neighborhoods across the city. That's the end of my report and I'm ready for any questions.
Speaker 5: Well, I'll just give you a comment and say, you know, I'm looking forward to this. I know many of our residents are looking forward to it. And as you say, stakeholders as well in the area. I think this project will this assessment will help tie in Virginia Village. Which has already seen significant city investment. On that with the Forest Wetlands Project is coming to Earth as well. And so Market Street is a is a is a priority for this. My office and you can count on my full participation in my office is full participation in this assessment process can make it successful.

"Boston (CNN)Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's bombs tore through their bodies: singeing flesh, shattering bones, shredding muscles and severing limbs. But on Tuesday, jurors also began to hear about the holes his bombs left in the hearts of the survivors and the families of the dead. Now that he has been found guilty on every count, the jury must decide whether Boston Marathon bomber Tsarnaev, 21, should live or die for what he has done. This is the victim impact part of the case, and the testimony was heartbreaking. Four young people are gone, and grief fills the spaces they once occupied. A father with a shock of white hair cried for the daughter he called ""Princess."" ""Krystle was the light of my life. She was extremely smart, hardworking, beautiful, every father's dream. I miss her a lot,"" said William A. Campbell Sr., dabbing at his eyes as he described his daughter, a 29-year-old restaurant manager who was killed in the first blast at the 2013 Boston Marathon. She was the one who could round up the family and put on big celebrations, he said. ""Nobody fills that boot now."" Others are expected to come and cry for Lingzi Lu, ""a jolly soul,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini said, quoting the slain Chinese grad student's father. More tears will be shed for Martin Richard, who was 8 and looked just like his dad. And for Sean Collier, who was remembered at his memorial service by these words: ""Big heart, big smiles, big service. All love."" ""Dzhokhar Tsarnaev murdered each one of them in a way that they had time to feel pain, they had time to be scared and frightened, but they had no time to say good-bye,"" Pellegrini told the jury. ""And that is the very essence of terror."" Timeline of bombings, manhunt and aftermath. To understand the toll Tsarnaev's bombs took, jurors must know the stories of his victims, the prosecutor said. ""These young women, this young man and this little boy, all of them were loved and they loved in return,"" Pellegrini said. ""Before he murdered them in some of the cruelest ways imaginable, they were sons, they were daughters, they were grandchildren, they were brothers and they were sisters."" Jurors saw photograph after photograph of smiling, happy people with arms around siblings at weddings and birthday parties and family gatherings. There was the photo of Campbell as a little girl in a red tap-dancing outfit. And then came the one that made her father smile through his tears. She was a little older and wearing a baseball uniform. ""She traded that in for a bat,"" Campbell said. ""She wasn't really a girly girl, but she loved to whitewater, camp, play baseball. She had a good arm on her. I was very proud of her."" By contrast, jurors also were left with an indelible image of Tsarnaev, taken when he was in a holding cell in the very courthouse where the trial is being held. It is dated July 10, 2013 -- the day of his arraignment on charges he deliberately set off the deadly bombs at the Boston Marathon. He glares into the camera defiantly, his middle finger raised in a profane salute. ""This is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged,"" Pellegrini said. ""Without remorse, he remains untouched by the grief and the loss that he caused."" Tsarnaev saw the people he killed as ""the enemy,"" she said. As a result, two women and a man never reached the age of 30, and a little boy never made it to the third grade. ""He knew they were innocents. He even called them that,"" Pellegrini added, referring to the message Tsarnaev scrawled onto the sides of a boat where he hid from police after the bombings. ""But it didn't stop him from murdering them."" The people who were maimed by Tsarnaev's bombs are also testifying during the sentencing phase of the trial as prosecutors try to show the impact on victims of the attacks. The stories they told on the witness stand were even more gripping and horrific than the stories told during the guilt phase of Tsarnaev's trial. When the first of the two bombs went off, Gillian Reny, a senior in high school, was standing near the woman she came to know was  Krystle Campbell. ""There was a complete, utter chilling silence and then chaos. Chaos like I'd never seen and never hope to see again,"" she said. The force of the blast knocked her to the ground. When she looked around, she saw blood and muscle everywhere. Her shin bone had snapped and was protruding. ""Muscle was everywhere. It was the most horrifying image I could imagine. Just seeing that on my own body,"" she said, and began to cry. ""I remember looking around and it just seemed like there were bodies everywhere, blood everywhere."" Were you bleeding? she was asked. ""Yes, enormously. Looking down at the blood I was just shocked that much blood could come out of someone,"" she said. ""I was terrified that I was going to die. I did not know that I could be that injured and survive."" She said she began to scream. Her bone-chilling cries could be heard on a video played in court -- the most graphic of many graphic images the jury has been shown. Doctors were able to save Reny's leg, but others weren't so lucky. Celeste Corcoran lost both legs, one below the knee and the other above the knee. An amputation above the knee is the most difficult injury to recover from, jurors have learned at this trial. Corcoran was at the finish line, waiting for her sister to cross. ""And then our whole world just exploded,"" she said. ""I unfortunately remember every single detail."" She remembers being knocked to the ground, hearing nothing and then screams, and seeing blood everywhere. ""It's kind of hard to explain but I want to get it right for all of you to understand,"" she told the jury. She said it was ""a surreal, out-of-body experience.""  She remembers thinking, ""What was that?"" and wishing she could turn back time by five minutes. Her husband bent over her and told her it was a terrorist attack. By then, she began to feel pain worse than anything she had imagined. She wondered if she would die. ""It hurt too much. I just didn't care,"" she said. ""I remember thinking I was going to die, that no one could go through that much pain.  I knew it was very bad and I was thinking, 'Is this it? Am I going to die?' I remember thinking I wanted to die. The pain was too much. I wanted to die."" And then, she said, ""the mom in me"" took over. She remembers telling herself: "" 'Hell no, I don't want to die. I have too much living to do. Don't let this be the end. This can't be the end.'"" She remembers feeling relief once she arrived at the hospital, even as she signed the form authorizing doctors to take both her legs. ""Can I get on with my life? Absolutely,"" she said. But she can never forget she's a double amputee. ""There's always a level of discomfort. Right now I'm not comfortable,"" she said from the witness stand. ""The bottoms of my limbs, there's this constant numb burning sensation. The only way I can describe it is it's like you have the worst athlete's foot in my life."" Sometimes, she feels a stabbing sensation where her toes and calves used to be. ""You don't realize until you're a double amputee how many dips and hills and inclines there are,"" she said. ""Inclines are very hard."" Daily life is literally an uphill battle. Opinion: What Tsarnaev deserves. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.

"Tokyo (CNN)A second robotic probe sent into the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant has captured images of a strange green glow. Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) deployed the second remote-controlled robot last week after the first one broke down. The robot detected lower radiation levels and temperature than expected, an indicator that cooling systems were working effectively, according to a statement released by TEPCO. ""It is a great step forward towards the decommissioning work as we can earn necessary data for the next investigation,"" said Akira Ono, the chief of Fukushima Daiichi plant. TEPCO said the yellow seen on the images seemed to suggest a discoloration of the grating, though the cause was unknown. It said the green glow could not be seen when filmed from other angles. The shape-shifting robots were sent in to assess the damage in one of the reactors that suffered a meltdown after a devastating earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. TEPCO says the site's still too dangerous for workers to enter. The first robot, which was sent in on April 10, stalled after moving about 10 meters, according to a statement released by TEPCO.  A report and footage from the robot shows that a fallen object had blocked its path and left it stranded. TEPCO decided to cut off the cable connected to the device on April 12 as it had already collected data on radiation levels in 14 of the 18 targeted locations, completing around two-thirds of the originally planned route. The second robot was sent in on April 15 and collected data from all 11 points, as scheduled. Four years after the devastating nuclear crisis, the radiation levels inside the three damaged reactors are still extremely high and remain unsafe for people to enter. Decommissioning work is estimated to cost $50 billion and will take years to complete. TEPCO called the robotic probe an ""unprecedented"" experiment. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki and Junko Ogura reported from Tokyo, Japan and Naomi Ng wrote from Hong Kong.

"[1] Onions spew enzymes and sulfenic acid when their skin is broken. These compounds combine to produce propanethial S-oxide, an irritating gas.
Propanethial S-oxide is a lachrymatory agent, meaning that it generates tears when it touches the eye. Propanethial S-oxide turns into sulfuric acid when it touches the water layer that covers and protects your eyeballs.
But just like onions, your eyes are also equipped with a defense mechanism meant to protect them from harm. When the nerves in each eye detect a lachrymatory agent, they generate tears to flush it out.

[2] The tears you shed while chopping onions are not caused by any type of emotion. They’re reflex tears stimulated by exposure to irritants.

[3] ""Your eyes have a set of nerves that detect anything that's potentially harmful to your eyes. Your eyes react to the gas that is formed, and your eyes try to flush it out with tears,"" Rosa explained in a school news release.
However, onions pose no serious threat to your visual health.
""Chopping onions can cause some burning and irritation and tears. Other than that, it's pretty safe on your eyes. It's a temporary sensation with no known long-term effects, nor will it worsen any other conditions, like pink eye,"" Rosa said.
Goggles can prevent the gas from reaching your eyes while cutting onions, but they aren't really necessary, he added.
""Some people may cut the onions in a bowl of water,"" Rosa said. ""I'd personally recommend using eye drops, like comfort drops, to help lubricate or rinse the eyes and dilute the gas exposure to the eyes.""","Goggles can be worn to prevent the gas from reaching the eyes while cutting onions, although they are not really necessary.",1,1,0.9830142259597778

There are thousands of these within databases, especially those involving Black women, as details are either unknown or the authorities haven’t shared any information that could help with the investigation. The story of Wardi McDonald reads like several others, as she vanished from Detroit, Michigan, on February 1, 2001.
It has already been established that it isn’t much known about this case, but it has been shared that the 34-year-old’s siblings were the last to see her. Where she was, who she may have been with, if she was traveling to or from another location, or any information about her personal or professional life remains a mystery. Sadly, nothing has been revealed about Wardi besides her physical attributes that could help her identify.
Wardi is listed as an endangered missing person, but it is also unclear why the police decided on that classification.
At the time of her disappearance, Wardi McDonald stood 5 feet 3 to 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighed 120 to 130 pounds. She had brown hair with red/auburn tint kept short, and brown eyes. What she was last seen wearing is unknown. She reportedly has a mole on her nose and burns on half of her back.

"Introduction

So far we have been using C language for simple console output only. Most of us are unaware that using C++, low level graphics program can also be made. This means we can incorporate shapes,colors and designer fonts in our program. This article deals with the steps to enable the DevC++ compiler to generate graphics .

Configuring DevC++

Step 1: Download the DevC++ version 5.11 from here.

Download the DevC++ version 5.11 from here. Step 2: Download the Graphics header files, and etc stuff needed from the given dropbox link.

Download the Graphics header files, and etc stuff needed from the given dropbox link. Step 3: Extract the contents of the rar file.

Extract the contents of the rar file. Step 4: Go to the location where DevC++ is installed. For me its D drive. Go inside the MinGW64 folder. Copy the graphics.h and winbgim.h in the include folder and D:\Dev-Cpp\MinGW64\x86_64-w64-mingw32\include folder.

Go to the location where DevC++ is installed. For me its D drive. Go inside the MinGW64 folder. Copy the graphics.h and winbgim.h in the include folder and D:\Dev-Cpp\MinGW64\x86_64-w64-mingw32\include folder. Step 5: Copy the libbgi.a file into lib folder and in D:\Dev-Cpp\MinGW64\x86_64-w64-mingw32\lib folder.

Copy the libbgi.a file into lib folder and in D:\Dev-Cpp\MinGW64\x86_64-w64-mingw32\lib folder. Step 6: Copy the ConsoleAppGraphics.template, ConsoleApp_cpp_graph.txt files and paste them inside the template folder of the devc++ installer location.

Now we are done with configuring of the DevC++ to support graphics programming. We shall write our very first graphics program now.

Running the first graphics program

Open DevC++. Click file ->New ->Project. Make sure you get the Console Graphics option. However, we are not going to click on it. Choose Empty Project option and Give a project name and make sure the selected language is C++. Copy the following code to the editor window. #include<graphics.h> #include <conio.h> int main() { int gd = DETECT, gm; initgraph(&gd,&gm, ""C:\\tc\\bgi""); circle(300,300,50); closegraph(); getch(); } Go to “Project” menu and choose “Project Options” (or just press ALT+P). Go to the “Parameters” tab In the “Linker” field, enter the following text:

-lbgi

-lgdi32

-lcomdlg32

-luuid

-loleaut32

-lole32

Click OK and Compile and run the project and you’ll get this output:

Program Explanation

The initgraph function- ?Initializes the graphics system.

In C Program execution starts with main() similarly Graphics Environment Starts with this function.

initgraph() initializes the graphics system by loading a graphics driver from disk (or validating a registered driver) then putting the system into graphics mode

Code Structure#

Majority of the code is located in AirLib. This is a self-contained library that you should be able to compile with any C++11 compiler.

AirLib consists of the following components:

Physics engine: This is header-only physics engine. It is designed to be fast and extensible to implement different vehicles. Sensor models: This is header-only models for Barometer, IMU, GPS and Magnetometer. Vehicle models: This is header-only models for vehicle configurations and models. Currently we have implemented model for a MultiRotor and a configuration for PX4 QuadRotor in the X config. There are several different Multirotor models defined in MultiRotorParams.hpp including a hexacopter as well. API-related files: This part of AirLib provides abstract base class for our APIs and concrete implementation for specific vehicle platforms such as MavLink. It also has classes for the RPC client and server.

Apart from these, all common utilities are defined in common/ subfolder. One important file here is AirSimSettings.hpp which should be modified if any new fields are to be added in settings.json .

AirSim supports different firmwares for Multirotor such as its own SimpleFlight, PX4 and ArduPilot, files for communicating with each firmware are placed in their respective subfolders in multirotor/firmwares .

The vehicle-specific APIs are defined in the api/ subfolder, along-with required structs. The AirLib/src/ contains .cpp files with implementations of various mehtods defined in the .hpp files. For e.g. MultirotorApiBase.cpp contains the base implementation of the multirotor APIs, which can also be overridden in the specific firmware files if required.

This is the only portion of project which is dependent on Unreal engine. We have kept it isolated so we can implement simulator for other platforms as well, as has been done for Unity. The Unreal code takes advantage of its UObject based classes including Blueprints. The Source/ folder contains the C++ files, while the Content/ folder has the blueprints and assets. Some main components are described below:

SimMode_ classes: The SimMode classes help implement many different modes, such as pure Computer Vision mode, where there is no vehicle or simulation for a specific vehicle (currently car and multirotor). The vehicle classes are located in Vehicles/ PawnSimApi: This is the base class for all vehicle pawn visualizations. Each vehicle has their own child (Multirotor|Car|ComputerVision)Pawn class. UnrealSensors: Contains implementation of Distance and Lidar sensors. WorldSimApi: Implements most of the environment and vehicle-agnostic APIs

Apart from these, PIPCamera contains the camera initialization, and UnrealImageCapture & RenderRequest the image rendering code. AirBlueprintLib has a lot of utility and wrapper methods used to interface with the UE4 engine.

This is the library developed by our own team member Chris Lovett that provides C++ classes to talk to the MavLink devices. This library is stand alone and can be used in any project. See MavLinkCom for more info.

Sample Programs#

We have created a few sample programs to demonstrate how to use the API. See HelloDrone and DroneShell. DroneShell demonstrates how to connect to the simulator using UDP. The simulator is running a server (similar to DroneServer).

PythonClient contains Python API wrapper files and sample programs demonstrating their uses.

See Contribution Guidelines

"[1] The main culprit is aspargusic acid, which is found exclusively in asparagus. When asparagus is digested, asparagusic acid gets broken down into sulfur containing byproducts. Sulfur, in general, is not very pleasant to smell, notes Dr. Bobart. When you pee, the sulfur byproducts evaporate almost immediately, causing you to smell that unpleasant scent.It’s worth noting that asparagus isn’t the only thing that can change the smell of your pee. Other foods and drinks have been known to cause smelly urine. For example, some people report that drinking too much coffee causes their urine to smell like coffee. Brussels sprouts, onions and garlic have also been linked to odd smelling pee in some people.Asparagus pee usually shows up between 15 and 30 minutes after eating the vegetable and can last for several hours. One study found that the smell could last for up to 14 hours!

[2] Asparagus urine odor has been observed for centuries. So before you start wondering if something is wrong with you, rest assured asparagus pee is a totally normal bodily reaction.Depending on what study you read, it’s estimated that between 20% to 50% of people experience it. For those who don’t get to encounter the joy of asparagus pee, researchers believe the reason might be two-fold: 1. Everyone digests food differently and some people can break down the sulfur byproducts more efficiently.
2. Some people lack the ability to detect the odor simply because of genetic variations.

[3] Asparagus is notorious for making urine smelly. But if this veggie doesn't give your pee a funky odor, that's normal, too.Dr. Dutta says everyone digests food differently, and some can get away with eating asparagus without any change in their urine. ""It's most likely because their body doesn't have the enzyme they need to break it down completely,"" she explains. But others do have the enzyme, and when those people digest asparagus, ""their bodies make something called a sulfur metabolite, which can make the urine have a sulfur or ammonia smell.""

"SCIUTTO: The Republican candidate for Florida's governor under fire once again. Just days after Congressman Ron DeSantis was accused of using a racist term, the “Washington Post“ reports that DeSantis spoke at multiple racially charged events, this dating back to 2013. At these conferences, you'd hear hundreds of people, many of the speakers right-wing speakers, but also some of them known racists, bigots, Milo Yiannopoulos, Sebastian Gorka, who's had anti-Muslim positions. CNN's senior Washington correspondent, Joe Johns, joins me now. So first of all, at these events, you have a variety of viewpoints, many from the right, certainly not all racists and not all bigoted, but those kinds of voices seem to be a regular feature at these events.
JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Right. And I think it's important for a variety of reasons. Number one, because, right now -- and you have to underscore this -- he's running against an African-American candidate, Andrew Gillum, who's the Tallahassee mayor, and he makes a comment, for example, on television, saying, we don't want to “monkey up the state.“ And the question, of course, was whether that was a racist comment or not. He said it wasn't intended to be racist. But now you overlay that with this disclosure in the “Washington Post“ that he's appeared four times before this group, organized by a conservative who has brought in these types of viewpoints, repeatedly. Then it starts to paint a bit of a more of a picture. And also important, I think, because the African-American community, already galvanized by the possibility of first African-American governor for the state of Florida, and now has these questions about the Republican candidate.
SCIUTTO: And the point about DeSantis -- and some of this came up when he used the racially charged term -- is that, here's an experienced politician, sitting Congressman, I believe he's a military vet.
JOHNS: Right.
SCIUTTO: Smart guy, right? But he's been -- if he's been going to these events, going back to 2013, none of this should be a surprise to him, right? You wouldn't go to the event and not know the kind of stuff that is being said.
JOHNS: Right. And the question becomes whether this is all a wink and a nod to bring out those voters who support right-wing notions. Of course, he's also considered a very big Donald Trump supporter.
SCIUTTO: So he's resigned his seat. He's also not running again for his congressional seat. But we're early September.
JOHNS: Right.
SCIUTTO: So until that election, there's been several weeks here, where no one's sitting in that seat.
JOHNS: Precisely. And Florida is trying to figure out what to do. They are planning a conference call this afternoon to determine whether or not there ought to be a special election to have somebody in that seat, the sixth district, through the end of December, into the beginning of January, when the new Congress is sworn in. Because the question is whether there's enough time, particularly, to get military ballots out, which have to go out 45 days before the election, and what are they going to do? Because somebody's got to be in that seat, presumably, if they can, until January.
SCIUTTO: But there are already candidates in place, Democratic and Republican, to fill that seat in the regular general election.
JOHNS: Right. The primary was the 28th of August. There's a Republican, there's a Democrat, and DeSantis was presumed to be not running.
SCIUTTO: Right. Joe Johns, thanks very much for clearing up for us. That is it for me today, Jim Sciutto, sitting in for Wolf. NEWSROOM with Brooke Baldwin starts right now.
BROOKE BALDWIN, CNN ANCHOR: All right. Hi, there. I'm Brooke Baldwin. Thank you so much for being with me. We are minutes away from the first White House briefing in nearly three weeks. It comes as President Trump claims the White House is a smooth-running machine, despite the fact that his own vice president has offered to take a lie detector test. It's to prove he did not write that withering “New York Times“ opinion piece, slamming the president, and as administration officials try to figure out which one of their own is not telling the truth. The president is calling Bob Woodward a liar. The acclaimed journalist, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist of Watergate fame, debuts his Trump tell-all, “Fear“ -- the name of his book -- tomorrow. And the president is discrediting Woodward's account of an administration in an unprecedented crisis. Trump tweeted, the Woodward book is a, quote, “scam,“ and a “joke“ that should not be taken with a grain of salt. And here is what he says about Woodward. Trump cites Savannah Guthrie, the host of the “Today“ show, who interviewed Woodward this morning. Quote, “It is mostly anonymous sources in here. Why should anyone trust you? General Mattis, General Kelly said it's not true.“ Trump then writes, quote, “Bob Woodward is a liar who is like a Dem operative prior to the midterms. He was caught cold even by NBC.“","Trump discredits Woodward's book, ""Fear,"" as a ""scam"" and a ""joke,"" citing Savannah Guthrie's interview with Woodward and suggesting that he is a Democrat operative.",1,0,0.006611899007111788
"It’s not about looks. Taking action to lose weight could save your life.
If you weigh more than you should, you’re not alone. People everywhere weigh more than they did a decade ago. In fact, the rate of obesity has doubled over the past 30 years.
This may be why heart disease remains the world’s leading killer. Multiple studies have confirmed the connection between obesity and death in men and women alike.
“As your body-mass index (BMI, a measurement of obesity) goes up, your risk of dying increases,” says preventive cardiologist Haitham Ahmed, MD, MPH.
In the Nurses Health Study , the risk of death rose 10% in those who moved from a normal BMI to the overweight category. That risk rose by 20 to 30% when they moved into the obesity category. In those with Category III obesity, the risk of death rose by nearly 100%, and cardiac death was four times that of a person with normal BMI.
There is at least one group of patients for whom obesity has not been associated with harm: those with heart failure . Patients with heart failure who are underweight or have a normal BMI may be more likely to die than those who have obesity.
While those who have obesity who develop heart failure live longer with the disease, they tend to develop heart failure at a younger age and die younger than heart-failure patients of normal weight.
Researchers aren’t sure what makes obesity dangerous. They think it’s not the fat itself , but that the fat worsens other risk factors. “In this respect, extra weight doesn’t directly cause heart attacks, but it facilitates other interactions that can,” says Dr. Ahmed. “High cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes and smoking cause plaque to build up in the arteries. We think obesity interacts with these other risk factors to make plaque build up faster.”
Extra weight triggers insulin resistance, which creates a dangerous cycle that can spiral out of control.
The more fat you have, the more insulin resistant you become. This causes your body to secrete more insulin, which makes you store fat. Then you become more insulin resistant, make more insulin, store more fat, and before you know it, you have metabolic syndrome or diabetes , which nearly triples the risk of heart attack and stroke.
Body fat also affects blood lipid levels . The more you weigh, the higher your LDL and triglyceride levels and the lower your levels of beneficial HDL cholesterol are likely to be.
Blood pressure rises when the heart has to pump harder to deliver blood to a growing network of arteries in a larger body. Over time, the struggling heart muscle becomes thicker, increasing the risk of developing heart failure and arrhythmias.
Additionally, people with obesity also have sleep apnea , which causes them to stop breathing up to hundreds of times a night. Sleep apnea increases the risk of heart attack or death by 30% in only four or five years. People who suffer from sleep apnea tend to feel hungry, gain weight from snacking and have trouble losing weight when they try.
That’s a hard question to answer since it’s really determined by your height and muscle mass.
That’s why BMI was developed. To calculate your BMI, divide your weight in pounds by your height in inches squared and multiply the number by 703. A BMI of 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal, 25-29.9 is having overweight, 30 to 35 is having obesity and 36 or more is having Class III obesity (formerly called morbidly obese).
There’s an easier way to determine whether you have overweight or obesity . Simply take out a tape measure and measure your waist right above the hip bones.

"Your doctor will ask about your medical history, review the medications you take, conduct a physical exam and may order tests to determine what's causing your diarrhea. Possible tests include:
- Blood test. A complete blood count test, measurement of electrolytes and kidney function tests can help indicate the severity of your diarrhea.
- Stool test. Your doctor might recommend a stool test to see if a bacterium or parasite is causing your diarrhea.
- Hydrogen breath test. This type of test can help your doctor determine if you have a lactose intolerance. After you drink a liquid that contains high levels of lactose, your doctor measures the amount of hydrogen in your breath at regular intervals. Breathing out too much hydrogen indicates that you aren't fully digesting and absorbing lactose.
- Flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. Using a thin, lighted tube that's inserted in your rectum, your doctor can see inside your colon. The device is also equipped with a tool that allows your doctor to take a small sample of tissue (biopsy) from your colon. Flexible sigmoidoscopy provides a view of the lower colon, while colonoscopy allows the doctor to see the entire colon.
- Upper endoscopy. Doctors use a long, thin tube with a camera on the end to examine your stomach and upper small intestine. They may remove a tissue sample (biopsy) for analysis in the laboratory.
Most cases of acute diarrhea clear on their own within a couple of days without treatment. If you've tried lifestyle changes and home remedies for diarrhea without success, your doctor might recommend medications or other treatments.
Antibiotics or anti-parasitic medications might help treat diarrhea caused by bacteria or parasites. If a virus is causing your diarrhea, antibiotics won't help.
Your doctor likely will advise you to replace the fluids and salts. For most adults, that means drinking water with electrolytes, juice or broth. If drinking liquids upsets your stomach or causes vomiting, your doctor might recommend getting IV fluids.
Water is a good way to replace fluids, but it doesn't contain the salts and electrolytes — minerals such as sodium and potassium — that are essential for your body to function. You can help maintain your electrolyte levels by drinking fruit juices for potassium or eating soups for sodium. But certain fruit juices, such as apple juice, might make diarrhea worse.
For children, ask your doctor about using an oral rehydration solution, such as Pedialyte, to prevent dehydration or replace lost fluids.
If your doctor determines that an antibiotic caused your diarrhea, he or she might lower your dose or switch to another medication.
If your diarrhea is caused by a more serious condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease, your doctor will work to control that condition. You might be referred to a specialist, such as a gastroenterologist, who can help devise a treatment plan for you.

Diarrhea usually clears up quickly without treatment. To help you cope with your signs and symptoms until the diarrhea goes away, try to do the following:
- Drink plenty of liquids, including water, broths and juices. Avoid caffeine and alcohol.
- Add semisolid and low-fiber foods gradually as your bowel movements return to normal. Try soda crackers, toast, eggs, rice or chicken.
- Avoid certain foods such as dairy products, fatty foods, high-fiber foods or highly seasoned foods for a few days.
Ask about anti-diarrheal medications. Over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medications, such as loperamide and bismuth subsalicylate, might help reduce the number of watery bowel movements and control severe symptoms.
Certain medical conditions and infections — bacterial and parasitic — can be worsened by these medications because they prevent your body from getting rid of what's causing the diarrhea. Some of these medications are not recommended for children. Check with your doctor before taking these medications or giving them to a child.
- Consider taking probiotics. These microorganisms may help restore a healthy balance to the intestinal tract by boosting the level of good bacteria, though it's not clear if they can help shorten a bout of diarrhea. Probiotics are available in capsule or liquid form and are also added to some foods, such as certain brands of yogurt. Further research is needed to better understand which strains of bacteria are most helpful or what doses are needed.
You might start by seeing your primary care practitioner. If you have persistent diarrhea, you may be referred to a doctor who specializes in the digestive system (gastroenterologist).
Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.
When you make the appointment, ask if there's anything you need to do in advance, such as fast before certain tests. Make a list of:
- Your symptoms, including when they began and any that may seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment.
- Key personal information, including any major stresses, recent life changes or travel.
- Medications, vitamins or supplements you take, including doses. If you've recently taken an antibiotic, note what kind, for how long and when you stopped.
- Questions to ask your doctor.
For diarrhea, some basic questions to ask your doctor include:
- What is likely causing my diarrhea?
- Could my diarrhea be caused by a medication I'm taking?
- What tests do I need?
- Is my diarrhea likely temporary or chronic?
- What is the best course of action?
- What are the alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?
- I have other health conditions. How can I best manage them with the diarrhea?
- Are there restrictions I should follow?
- May I take medication such as loperamide to slow the diarrhea down?
- Should I see a specialist?
Don't hesitate to ask other questions.
Your doctor is likely to ask you questions, including:
- When did your symptoms begin?
- Have your symptoms been continuous or occasional?
- How severe are your symptoms?
- What, if anything, seems to improve your symptoms?
- What, if anything, appears to worsen your symptoms?
- Does your diarrhea awaken you at night?
- Do you see blood, or are your bowel movements black in color?
- Have you recently been around anyone who has diarrhea?
- Have you recently stayed in a hospital or nursing home?
- Have you taken antibiotics recently?
While you wait for your appointment, you may ease your symptoms if you:
- Drink more fluids. To help avoid dehydration, drink water, juice and broth.
- Avoid foods that can aggravate diarrhea. Avoid fatty, high-fiber or highly seasoned foods.","For most adults, replacing fluids and salts with water, juice or broth is recommended to treat diarrhea caused by bacteria or parasites.",1,1,0.6895259022712708
"West of Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)Falih Essawi shouted on the phone as he described his situation. From his point of view, ISIS militants might be just hours away from taking the key Iraqi city of Ramadi. Fierce fighting has engulfed Ramadi, which lies only about 70 miles (113 kilometers) west of Baghdad and is the capital of Anbar province, Iraq's Sunni heartland. Essawi, the deputy head of the Anbar Provincial Council, told CNN from inside the city Wednesday that it's unclear how much longer government troops can hold their front lines against the ISIS offensive. The politician said he was on a front line himself, armed with a machine gun. Security was ""collapsing rapidly in the city,"" and he begged the Iraqi government for reinforcements and the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS for air support. He stressed that urgent support from the military and security forces is needed to save the city. ""This is what we warned Baghdad of what's going to happen,"" Essawi told CNN by phone, referring to the Iraqi government at the capital. ""Where is Baghdad? Where is al-Abadi?"" His plea for help comes the day after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi met with U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington to seek more support for the fight against ISIS. ""Just Allah knows if we will survive this,"" Essawi said. According to the Anbar official, at least 10 Iraqi security forces were killed and more than 100 others were wounded in the fighting against ISIS on Wednesday. The extremist group's offensive in Ramadi shows its resilience despite months of U.S.-led airstrikes and its recent defeat by Iraqi forces in the northern city of Tikrit. ISIS fighters have Ramadi under pressure from several angles. Essawi said ISIS militants made significant advances Wednesday in three areas east of Ramadi: Albu Soda, Albu Ghanem and parts of Soufia, which leads to central Ramadi. Later, he said that militants were rolling into the center of Ramadi. Over the weekend, the militants seized control of areas north of Ramadi. Routes south of the city were taken some months ago. That leaves only areas to the west of Ramadi in the hands of government forces, but those positions are under threat, Essawi warned. The recent fighting has driven a steady stream of refugees out of the city. On Wednesday, some residents packed what they could into metal carts as they prepared to flee on foot. People also were fleeing the areas where ISIS was advancing east of Ramadi. At least 150,000 people have already fled since Wednesday morning, causing huge traffic jams on the roads leading outside the city, according to Essawi. A CNN team met with three families that had fled an ISIS assault in the Albu Ghanem area. Those families said Iraqi security and military forces withdrew from Albu Ghanem after a battle with ISIS, which took over the area quickly. One fleeing Albu Ghanem resident, Abu Ahmed, paused to talk to CNN as he and his family walked east toward Baghdad, crossing a bridge over the Euphrates River. He said four ISIS militants had entered his house and set up a sniper position on his roof. Abu Ahmed said he, his wife and four children walked away from the home with his elderly mother while the ISIS fighters were busy setting things up there. He said his family left everything behind. His family was using a cart to carry his mother, who couldn't walk. While talking about the fighters' takeover of his home, his wife started crying and asked God to help the rest of the families who are stuck in Albu Ghanem. Ramadi has seen intense and persistent fighting for months. ISIS took over parts of the city in the first half of last year, placing it at the heart of a deadly tug of war ever since. The U.S. military has carried out multiple airstrikes against ISIS targets near Ramadi in recent weeks. ""The coalition has been supporting the fight in Ramadi with airstrikes, and there have been seven airstrikes in Ramadi since Monday,"" Col. Ed Thomas, spokesman for Joint Chiefs Chairman Col. Martin Dempsey, said on Wednesday. He stressed that Ramadi remains contested. Another U.S. military official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CNN that the fall of Ramadi is ""not imminent."" Sizable parts of the city are under ISIS control or influence, but the area has been a target of a months-long offensive, that official said. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali and Arwa Damon reported from west of Baghdad, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Jason Hanna, Jim Sciutto, Jamie Crawford contributed to this report.

"Every day, images of war and conflict are splashed across our desktops, plastered on our TV screens and scattered through our mobile news feeds. Because of that, one's response to such imagery often becomes calloused or desensitized. This concept of ""how we digest images of war through mainstream media outlets,"" was what drove photographer Simon Brann Thorpe to begin his project ""Toy Soldiers."" This idea to create a fresh perspective drove him into the desert of Western Sahara, a long-disputed region of northwestern Africa. Thorpe uses the area's harsh landscape as a powerful backdrop for soldiers posed as green plastic figurines -- similar to the popular toys that many children play with. The soldiers are with the Polisario Front, an independence movement that has been clashing with Morocco over the region since the mid-1970s. Thorpe said his project enables ""the creation of a visual metaphor from which a viewer develops their own emotional, physical and political response to war and conflict, when faced with the realization that the images do not contain toy soldiers but real soldiers."" Thorpe's background was not in photojournalism, but in landscape photography, which lends to his powerful placement of the soldiers in the desert -- not to mention that all the locations chosen are historic locations of battles between Morocco and the Polisario Front. ""The conflict in Western Sahara receives virtually zero coverage despite 2015 being the 40th anniversary of the outbreak of war there,"" Thorpe said. After a ceasefire in 1991, the people of Western Sahara have been living in a state of non-resolution. The people are split into two camps -- those living in Moroccan-occupied territory, and those in refugee camps in Algeria. Social media. Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. Thorpe had to get clearance to work with the Polisario Front military and also had to be cautious of how many troops he moved about at one time -- otherwise he would have needed permission from the United Nations. He usually worked with about 50 or 60 soldiers at a time. The autumn months did not offer much reprieve from the long hours in the sweltering desert sun. Thorpe would work with the troops' commander to position the men, then climb atop sandy mountains with his wide-angle lens and capture these striking images. They would work till dusk and then spend the night under the stars. Not only were the soldiers willing participants for this project, but they also helped construct the platforms they stood on. Thorpe said they were made out of old oil drums. After the elaborate five-week production, Thorpe hopes his images will raise questions on ""how images of war (will) be consumed in the future with ever-diminishing attention spans and competition for them.""
